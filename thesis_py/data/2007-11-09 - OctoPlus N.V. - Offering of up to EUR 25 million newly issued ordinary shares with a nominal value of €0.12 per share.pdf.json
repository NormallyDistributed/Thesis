Locteron combines interferon alfa produced by our co-\ndevelopment partner, Biolex Therapeutics, Inc.

Our primary focus is on the aggressive\n    development of our most advanced product candidates so that they may be submitted for regulatory\n    approval. We currently have two product candidates in clinical trials. We have completed patient\n    treatment in a Phase IIa clinical trial of our lead product candidate Locteron for the treatment of chronic\n    HCV infection and are preparing for a Phase IIb clinical trial, which we expect to commence in the\n    middle of 2008. We also intend to commence a separate study in the United States in a difficult-to-treat\n    patient population later this year or in the first quarter of 2008. In addition, we are conducting a Phase II\n    clinical trial of OP-145 CSOM, our novel peptide for the treatment of chronic middle ear infection. The\n    treatment of patients in this study is expected to be completed by the end of 2007, and we expect to\n    report results in the first half of 2008.\n\n\u00b7   Continue to expand our product candidate portfolio by combining our drug delivery technologies\n    with known biopharmaceutical drugs or other therapeutics in need of clinical improvement. We\n    primarily intend to apply our proprietary drug delivery technologies to those product opportunities where\n    we can capitalize on the known safety, efficacy and often established drug development history of\n    existing drugs. We believe that our technologies may allow us to improve the performance of many of\n    these known biopharmaceutical drugs, of which drawbacks may include frequent or inconvenient dosing\n    schedules, injection site reactions, strong side effects and/or limited efficacy. More opportunistically, we\n    also intend to acquire or in-license product candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development that we\n    believe have clear potential for an improved clinical profile upon combination with one of our drug\n    delivery technologies. We would require such development programs to be synergistic with our then\n    existing product portfolio. Our goal is to initiate one new development program per year.\n\n\u00b7   Capture value by entering into partnerships with large pharmaceutical or biotechnology\n    companies for our product candidates. We intend to create value by licensing our product candidates\n    for further development and commercialization at a stage where the risk/reward balance would make\n    such partnership attractive for us. In most cases, this would typically occur with the completion of Phase\n    II clinical trials. For product candidates that target smaller markets, we may decide to complete the\n    development process ourselves and establish a commercial infrastructure to directly commercialize such\n    products in certain territories.\n\n\u00b7   Further expand the potential applications of our drug delivery platforms. We believe that our\n    proprietary drug delivery technologies have broad applicability. We continually seek to improve and find\n    new applications for our OctoDEX and PolyActive platforms in order to remain competitive in\n    developing controlled release formulations of many classes of drugs and therapeutic proteins. As an\n    example, we have developed a modified version of our OctoDEX technology, OctoVAX, as a basis for\n    an innovative, single-shot approach to prophylactic vaccines. We believe that OctoDEX and PolyActive\n    can be used to enhance the performance of a range of therapeutics.

Patients may not realize that they have been infected with HCV until 10 to 30\nyears after initial exposure, in part because of the lack of obvious symptoms.\n", "page_number": 53, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.636285836542576, "lower_right_x": 0.8802177858439202, "lower_right_y": 0.7325631151048353, "height": 0.09627727856225932, "width": 0.7598306110102844}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 8, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-53-8", "text": "   The World Health Organization (the \u201cWHO\u201d) estimates that 180 million people globally are infected with\nHCV, with 3 to 4 million new infections per year.

We believe each of these factors may lead to\nimproved efficacy.\n", "page_number": 55, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.16878402903811252, "top_left_y": 0.23577235772357724, "lower_right_x": 0.8802177858439202, "lower_right_y": 0.5121951219512195, "height": 0.2764227642276423, "width": 0.7114337568058077}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-55-5", "text": "", "page_number": 55, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1367211131276467, "top_left_y": 0.24304664099272572, "lower_right_x": 0.14277071990320628, "lower_right_y": 0.24604193410355157, "height": 0.0029952931108258585, "width": 0.006049606775559574}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-55-6", "text": "\u00b7\n", "page_number": 55, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1355111917725348, "top_left_y": 0.3247753530166881, "lower_right_x": 0.14519056261343014, "lower_right_y": 0.33119383825417203, "height": 0.006418485237483951, "width": 0.009679370840895346}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 7, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-55-7", "text": "\u00b7\n", "page_number": 55, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1355111917725348, "top_left_y": 0.4206247325631151, "lower_right_x": 0.14519056261343014, "lower_right_y": 0.42704321780059906, "height": 0.006418485237483951, "width": 0.009679370840895346}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 8, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-55-8", "text": "Locteron Development Activities and Strategy\n", "page_number": 55, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.5267436884895165, "lower_right_x": 0.45493042952208107, "lower_right_y": 0.540436456996149, "height": 0.01369276850663248, "width": 0.33454325468844526}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 9, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-55-9", "text": "   We have completed patient treatment with Locteron in a Phase IIa study in HCV patients.

Of the 2 billion people who have been infected with the hepatitis B virus, more than 350 million\npeople have chronic infections. About 90% of infants infected during the first year of life and 30-50% of\nchildren infected between one and four years of age develop chronic infection. In persons over the age of five\nyears, approximately 6% of infected individuals become chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus. These chronic\ncarriers of the hepatitis B virus are at high risk of developing hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer,\ndiseases that result in about one million deaths annually. Prophylactic vaccines for hepatitis B infection are\navailable and can prevent the development of chronic infections and thereby reduce associated morbidity and\nmortality. The worldwide market for hepatitis B vaccines is estimated at over $1 billion. Although vaccination\nagainst infection by hepatitis B is part of a national immunization program in many countries, still large\nnumbers of individuals born prior to the implementation of these programs are unvaccinated and are at risk of\nthe disease. Furthermore, the current technology employed in marketed hepatitis B vaccines necessitates that\nsubjects receive multiple shots over a six month period, leading to poor patient compliance with dosing\nregimens. According to a survey of US adolescents and adults published by the CDC, only 53% of those who\nreceived the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine received the second dose, and only 30% received the third. We\nbelieve that compliance rates in other countries are similarly low.

Under the intrinsic method, the measurement date is the first date on which the\nemployee knows the number of shares that such employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price. The\nmeasurement date is often the grant date; however, it may be later than the grant date in plans with variable\nterms that depend on events which occur after the grant date. These terms may be variable by design, may\nbecome variable due to their modification after the date of grant, or may be considered variable due to their\nrelationship to other stock option features. In such cases, compensation is measured at the end of each reporting\nperiod until the measurement date or, in some cases, until the stock option\u2019s exercise, forfeiture, or expiry.\n", "page_number": 135, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.4548566538296962, "lower_right_x": 0.8808227465214761, "lower_right_y": 0.6059050064184852, "height": 0.15104835258878901, "width": 0.7604355716878403}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54", "blob_id": "fb6086ee0287299382b9072a99297ca6b65ebf5a06a5914f3a58058394305f54-135-5", "text": "  Under the fair value method, the cost associated with warrants and options is based on the fair value at the\ndate of grant.
