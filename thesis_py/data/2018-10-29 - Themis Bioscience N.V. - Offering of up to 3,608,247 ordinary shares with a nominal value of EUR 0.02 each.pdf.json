In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability\nBoard (\"FSB\"), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The\nG20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant\nchanges in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex\nfinancial groups, should be regulated. The FSB has developed proposals to enhance the total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") of global systemically important banks in resolution. On 9 November 2015,\nthe FSB issued the final TLAC Standard (the \"TLAC Standard\") for global systemically important banks\n(\"G-SIBs\"). The TLAC Standard has been designed so that failing G-SIBs will have sufficient loss-\nabsorbing and recapitalisation capacity available in resolution for authorities to implement an orderly\nresolution that minimises impacts on financial stability, maintains the continuity of critical functions, and\navoids exposing public funds to loss. The TLAC Standard defines a minimum requirement for the\ninstruments and liabilities that should be readily available for bail-in within resolution at G-SIBs, but\ndoes not limit authorities\u2019 powers under the applicable resolution law to expose other liabilities to loss\nthrough bail-in or the application of other resolution tools. Work is currently ongoing in the EU to\nimplement the TLAC Standard into EU legislation. In particular the European Commission has\nproposed to incorporate TLAC into the capital requirement framework, as an extension to the own funds\nrequirements and as part of the EU Banking Reforms as discussed above under 'Minimum requirement\nfor own funds and eligible liabilities under SRM Regulation and BRRD'. Therefore, although the TLAC\nStandard will not be applicable to the Issuer because it is not a G-SIB, future capital and buffer\nrequirements applicable to the Issuer will increase in order to be more in line with the TLAC Standard\nfor G-SIBs and as a result there is a possibility that the Issuer will be required to strengthen its capital\nposition.
