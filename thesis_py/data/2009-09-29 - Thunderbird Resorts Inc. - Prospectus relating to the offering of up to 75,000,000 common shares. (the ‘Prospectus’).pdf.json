The six months ended 30 June 2009 results for the Group\u2019s\nGuatemala operation reflect higher sales and lower Property EBITDA than in the comparable 2008 period\nresults due to losses incurred in all of the properties. During 2008, the Group replaced the management team,\nimplemented a new cost control program and is attempting to rebuild its market presence. 2009 results reflect\nlosses driven by the slow ramp-up of sales and profitability related to the new Gran Plaza property that opened\nin June 2008. The Group elected to close its Coatepeque property in February 2009 and its Gran Plaza property\nin July 2009 and to utilize the gaming machines from these properties in other locations around the country.\n", "page_number": 52, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.6049593843522874, "lower_right_x": 0.8796128251663642, "lower_right_y": 0.7148353997434801, "height": 0.10987601539119274, "width": 0.7592256503327284}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 10, "document_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51", "blob_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51-52-10", "text": "                                                                                                   Six Months Ended\n                                                                                                        30 June              %\n(In thousands)                                                                                    2009          2008       Change\n\nVideo lottery terminal win.....................................................               $     1,717 $       1,754         -2.1%\nFood and beverage and other sales .......................................                             289           227         27.3%\nSales .....................................................................................         2,006         1,981          1.3%\nPromotional allowances.........................................................                                      \u2014              %\nProperty, marketing and administration.................................                             2,867         1,990         44.1%\nProperty EBITDA................................................................

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Group substantially\ncompleted a $10 million renovation program of the six hotels in Lima, Peru, while our flagship Fiesta Casino in\nLima opened in September 2008 in the Thunderbird Hotel Las Americas Suites with approximately 414 slot\nmachines and 188 table positions. This flagship Fiesta Casino required a capital investment of approximately\n$20.8 million, which included budgeted pre-opening costs and working capital of $4.5 million.\n", "page_number": 68, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.49551090209491233, "lower_right_x": 0.8802177858439202, "lower_right_y": 0.5917058572039333, "height": 0.09619495510902099, "width": 0.7598306110102844}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 9, "document_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51", "blob_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51-68-9", "text": "                                                                                                    Year ended\n(In thousands)                                                                                     31 December              %\n                                                                                               2008            2007       Change\n\nRoom sales.........................................................................        $    12,086 $         4,185       188.8%\nFood and beverage and banquet sales................................                              5,370           2,250       138.7%\nOther sales........................................................................                803             621        29.3%\nSales ..................................................................................        18,259           7,056       158.8%\nPromotional allowances.....................................................                         \u2014               \u2014           \u2014%\nProperty, marketing and administration.............................                             12,386           4,954       150.0%\nProperty EBITDA............................................................                $     5,873 $         2,102       179.4%\n   as a percent of sales ...................................................                        32%             30%\n", "page_number": 68, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.13490623109497882, "top_left_y": 0.6041043180846516, "lower_right_x": 0.8808227465214761, "lower_right_y": 0.7657118426678068, "height": 0.1616075245831552, "width": 0.7459165154264973}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 10, "document_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51", "blob_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51-68-10", "text": "         The Group acquired six hotels in Peru with a total of 660 rooms on 27 July 2007; therefore, the\noperation has only seven months of comparable data from 2007.

In connection with our acquisition of the Hoteles Las Americas properties in\nJuly 2007, we borrowed approximately $53.9 million from three groups of lenders, some of whom are local\npartners of ours in other countries. We repaid $5.0 million of those borrowings in November 2007 with\nproceeds of a private placement. In connection with those borrowings, we granted to one lending group (who\nloaned $18.6 million of the total amount) the right to 80% of \u201cAvailable Cash Flow\u201d generated by the Hoteles\nLas Americas properties for each year until the principal and interest for such year was paid. After the\noutstanding principal and interest are repaid in full, the lender retains a residual interest relating to the Hoteles\nLas America properties pursuant to which that lending group retains, after all principal and interest is repaid in\nfull with respect to the $18.6 million loan (which bears interest at 10%), (i) the right to 14% of the \u201cAvailable\nCash Flow\u201d with respect to the operations of the Hoteles Las Americas properties, including any of our casinos\ninstalled on those properties and (ii) the right to 14% of the proceeds of a sale of the Hoteles Las Americas\nproperties after the payment of all costs and expenses associated with such sale. \u201cAvailable Cash Flow\u201d for this\npurpose means cash available from the revenues generated by the Hoteles Las Americas casinos and hotels, after\ndeducting all costs associated with the ownership, leasing and operations of those facilities, including senior\ndebt service costs as well as operation, repair and maintenance costs, management fees, taxes, capital\nexpenditures, reasonable cash reserves and all other reasonable costs normal and customary to the ownership\nand operation of those facilities. The profits participation (i.e., the lending group\u2019s rights to 80% and 14% as\ndescribed above) is revalued at each year end using the present value of projected cash flows attributable to the\nliability, and discounting those cash flows at the effective interest rate (calculated at the inception of the loan). If\nthe present value of the cash flows is higher than the present value of the cash flows at the inception of the loan,\nthe amount of the loan would be increased to reflect the higher value and the difference would cause an\nadjustment in the income statement.\n", "page_number": 83, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12038717483363581, "top_left_y": 0.14578879863189398, "lower_right_x": 0.8802177858439202, "lower_right_y": 0.45746045318512185, "height": 0.3116716545532279, "width": 0.7598306110102844}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51", "blob_id": "c30565faf95098ff4ddf6ac3c571d02bc3b881c0e082d349f2cbd800f32dcf51-83-3", "text": "         Other.
