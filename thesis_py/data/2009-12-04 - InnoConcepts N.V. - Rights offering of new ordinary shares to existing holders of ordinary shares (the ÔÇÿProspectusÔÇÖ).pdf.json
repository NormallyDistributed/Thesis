In 2004, we changed\nour legal and economic relationship with Cheng Meng to a royalty agreement. As a result, Cheng\nMeng performed the sales activities, based on which we received royalties. In addition, Cheng\nMeng continues to use our moulds for the manufacturing of media packaging products on the\nbasis of a lease agreement between Cheng Meng and us.\n\nIn 2008, Cheng Meng decided to reorganise its operations in response to the declining multimedia\npackaging markets. In the middle of this reorganisation, the managing director of Cheng Meng\ndied in May 2008 and the general economic climate changed dramatically. At the request of\nCheng Meng, InnoConcepts sent its former CFO, Mr Van der Jagt, to stabilize Cheng Meng's\noperations. In the period mid-2008 to June 2009, he managed to get the factory up and running\nagain to nearby break-even levels. Subsequently, in July 2009 it appeared that Cheng Meng had\ntaken up bank loans using I-Pac\u2019s assets as collateral without informing InnoConcepts. To repay\nthese bank loans and provide additional working capital, Cheng Meng requested I-Pac to provide a\nloan in August 2009. To safeguard the value of I-Pac's receivables on Cheng Meng, valued as per\n30 June 2009 at \u20ac22.5 million, we decided to provide new funding up to \u20ac1.2 million. This\nfunding will take place through various draw downs and part of it is subject to a successful\nOffering. I-Pac obtained the right to convert the total receivable and the new loan into equity if\nCheng Meng fails to pay redemptions when due.

In 2005, we licensed our IM Technology for use in returnable\ntransport packaging (e.g. pallets and crates) to SAS. Subsequently, we licensed our IM Technology to\nvarious parties in the food packaging markets, most importantly WNA. In 2007, we granted an\nexploratory license for our IM Technology to IAC for the automotive industry. Finally, in 2008 we\ngranted a license to Hoogerman Group to explore the potential for our IM Technology in the consumer\nelectronics packaging area. In the near future we expect revenues related to our IM Technology from the\nmedia packaging and returnable transport packaging segment to be limited and we will therefore primarily\nfocus on food packaging and automotive. In addition, we continue to explore possibilities in returnable\ntransport packaging and consumer electronics packaging on a case-by-case basis.

So far, our sales team has made limited progress in the sale of these products resulting in\n       limited business to date for us. Therefore, we have decided to transfer these sales activities to\n       Dampack, and to focus our sales activity on IM Technology based moulds. As a result, we have\n       terminated employment contracts of staff related to this activity. The manufacturing of the food\n       packaging products is still carried out by Hoogerman under the existing contract manufacturing\n       agreement. Based on this agreement we expect to receive royalties on products sold by Dampack,\n       and to lower penalties due by us to Hoogerman as described in section \"Business - History\".\n\n\u2022      Third, we initiated our cost reduction program, which amongst other things, will include moving\n       our head-office from Barendrecht to our HTP location in Eindhoven by the end of this year.

In the middle of this reorganisation, the managing director of Cheng Meng died in\nMay 2008 and the general economic climate changed dramatically. At the request of Cheng Meng,\nInnoConcepts sent its former CFO, Mr Van der Jagt, to stabilize Cheng Meng's operations. In the period\nmid-2008 to June 2009, he managed to get the factory up and running again to nearby break-even levels.\nSubsequently, in July 2009 it appeared that Cheng Meng had taken up bank loans using I-Pac\u2019s assets as\ncollateral without informing InnoConcepts. To repay these bank loans and provide additional working\ncapital, Cheng Meng requested I-Pac to provide a loan in August 2009. To safeguard the value of I-Pac's\nreceivables on Cheng Meng, valued as per 30 June 2009 at \u20ac22.5 million, we decided to provide new\nfunding up to \u20ac1.2 million.

In the middle of the\nreorganization in May 2008, the Cheng Meng managing director died and the general economic climate\nchanged dramatically. At the request of Cheng Meng, InnoConcepts sent its former CFO, Mr Van der\nJagt, to stabilize Cheng Meng's operations. In the period mid-2008 to June 2009 he managed to get the\nfactory up and running again to nearby break-even levels. Subsequently, it appeared that Cheng Meng had\ntaken up bank loans using I-Pac\u2019s assets as collateral withour informing InnoConcepts. To repay these\nbank loans and provide additional working capital, Cheng Meng asked I-Pac to provide a loan. To\nsafeguard the value of I-Pac's receivables on Cheng Meng, valued as per 30 June 2009 at \u20ac22.5 million,\nwe decided to provide new funding up to \u20ac1.2 million. This funding will take place through various draw\ndowns and part of it is subject to a successful Offering. I-Pac obtained the right to convert the total\nreceivable and the new loan into equity if Cheng Meng fails to pay redemptions when due. The value of\nthe equity stake in Cheng Meng further to conversion, depends on the amount outstanding under the total\nreceivable and the new loan. The value of equity in Cheng Meng upon conversion will decrease as a result\nof redemptions made of the receivable and the new loan. As a result of market conditions in the multi-\nmedia packaging sector and the financial position of Cheng Meng, we do not expect any license income in\nthe near future.

There is no reason to\nsuspect that on the basis of the financial position of the fund at 31 December 2008, the amount of the chargeable\npremiums will change in the future. At 31 December 2008, the funding ratio for the Metalektro Industrial Pension\nFund was 90% calculated on the basis of the accounting policies of the Netherlands Pensions Act. The pension fund\ndeveloped a recovery plan in March 2009 designed to improve the fund\u2019s funding ratio. The most important impact\non the company is the increase of the total premium to be contributed from 22% to the maximum of 23%. This\nmaximum premium will remain in effect throughout the entire recovery period (2009 \u2013 2013).\nThe other plans qualify as defined contribution or defined benefit plans funded by contributions to pension\ninstitutions not related to InnoConcepts. InnoConcepts does not have any legally enforceable or actual obligations to\nmake supplementary contributions if these institutions unrelated to InnoConcepts were to have insufficient resources\nto make payments to all employees in connection with pensions relating to the services performed by employees in\ncurrent and past periods.

The basic premise of the liquidity risk management approach is to, as far as possible, maintain sufficient cash\nand cash equivalents to be able to meet current and future financial commitments, under normal and difficult\ncircumstances, without incurring unacceptable losses or endangering InnoConcepts\u2019 reputation in the process.\n\nInnoConcepts monitors its cash flows on a regular basis. A summary of the Group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents is\nproduced on a daily basis. A summary of the movements in the liquidity position is produced on a weekly basis. A\ncash flow analysis of the past quarter and a forecast for the coming quarter is prepared each quarter. A multi-year (3-\n5 years) cash flow forecast is prepared every 6 months. These reports help ensure that the Group has access to\nsufficient liquid assets over the short as well as long term in order to meet its operating and financial commitments.\nThe cash flow reports do not take extreme circumstances into consideration. In addition to the external financing\nreported in the balance sheet, InnoConcepts has access to the following credit facilities:\n\n-   A \u20ac 5,000,000 revolving credit facility negotiated with ING Bank with a definite term ending 1 September 2013.\n-   A \u20ac 400,000 revolving credit facility negotiated with Rabobank with an indeterminate term of renewal.\n-   A \u20ac1,000,000 (CZK 28,000,000) revolving credit facility with Raiffeisen Bank with a term ending 31 March\n    2009, renewable for a 1 year term each time.\n\nThe contractual terms of the financial commitments, excluding the estimated interest payments, are as follows:\n\nIn \u20ac 000s                          Carrying Value       < 6 mths     6-12 mths         1-2 yrs        2-5 yrs         > 5 yrs\nING Bank Amsterdam                         37,900          2,105         2,106          6,703         26,986                -\nRabobank Venlo                                550            100           100            200            150                -\nRaiffeisen Bank                               637            637             -               -              -               -\nOther commitments                          11,541          5,775         4,322          1,066            161             216\n\n\u20ac 3,500,000 of the revolving credit facility is used by a minority interest, for which InnoConcepts acts as the\nguarantor.\n\n7.3 Currency Risk\nCurrency risk is the risk that InnoConcepts\u2019 income or the value of assets is adversely affected by fluctuations in\nexchange rates.
