According to Euromonitor International, the Group has grown\n                               its market share in Turkey (as measured by the Group\u2019s system sales in\n                               chained pizza) from approximately 35% in 2010 to approximately 51% in\n                               2016. In addition, there has been a general growth trend of the OHD market\n                               in Turkey and Russia given their current underdeveloped status compared to\n                               other markets such as the United Kingdom and the United States, with 1.8\n                               outlets in Turkey per one thousand persons and 0.8 outlets in Russia per one\n                               thousand persons, compared to 2.5 outlets in the United Kingdom and 2.1\n                               outlets in the United States as of 2015, according to Euromonitor\n                               International and EIU. This creates significant growth potential.\n                               The Group believes the above trends will continue to                           drive the Group\u2019s\n                               growth and market growth in the pizza delivery                                 market generally,\n                               particularly in the context of the following matters,                         developments and\n                               trends of the Group in all of the jurisdictions in which                      it operates:\n                               \u2022     broad appeal, adaptability to local markets and growth potential trend\n                                     of the chained pizza market;\n                               \u2022     within this underpenetrated and expanding OHD sector, the Group is\n                                     well-positioned to take advantage of an increasing share of the fast-\n                                     food segment, pizza sub-segment and the delivery channel in which it\n                                     primarily competes;\n                               \u2022     attractive price points, consistent value-for-money offering and high\n                                     brand recognition of restaurant chains have contributed to significant\n                                     growth trend in the fast-food segment, including during economic\n                                     downturns, demonstrating resilience in the Group\u2019s addressable\n                                     markets;\n", "page_number": 7, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.058999572466866185, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.9085079093629757, "height": 0.8495083368961095, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-7-1", "text": "3\n", "page_number": 7, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.49274486094316805, "top_left_y": 0.9264643009833262, "lower_right_x": 0.5030229746070133, "lower_right_y": 0.9367250961949551, "height": 0.010260795211628926, "width": 0.010278113663845234}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-8-0", "text": "Disclosure requirement\n", "page_number": 8, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.35006045949214026, "top_left_y": 0.06241983753740915, "lower_right_x": 0.49334945586457074, "lower_right_y": 0.07652843095339888, "height": 0.014108593415989731, "width": 0.14328899637243048}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-8-1", "text": "Annex and Element\n", "page_number": 8, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11789600967351874, "top_left_y": 0.0645575032064985, "lower_right_x": 0.2418379685610641, "lower_right_y": 0.0748182984181274, "height": 0.010260795211628898, "width": 0.12394195888754536}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-8-2", "text": "\u2022   the development of the delivery distribution channel in Turkey and\n    Russia has contributed to the growth trend of the OHD market in both\n    countries.

The Group\u2019s marketing initiatives are exposed to the risk that, if in breach under\na Master Franchise Agreement, the relevant Master Franchisor is entitled to require that the Group operates on\nthis more restrictive basis, which could impact the effectiveness of its promotions. Additionally, many of the\nGroup\u2019s competitors are, and many of the Group\u2019s potential competitors may be, larger and may have greater\nfinancial, marketing and other resources, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products,\ngenerate greater international brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the Group is\nable to. Should the Group\u2019s advertising, promotions, new products and store designs and remodels be less\neffective than those of the Group\u2019s competitors for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on the\nGroup\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\n", "page_number": 25, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.24925181701581872, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.5027789653698161, "height": 0.2535271483539974, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-25-4", "text": "he Domino\u2019s Pizza brand and the Group\u2019s reputation are critical to its business\n", "page_number": 25, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.13301088270858524, "top_left_y": 0.5156049593843522, "lower_right_x": 0.7031438935912938, "lower_right_y": 0.5280034202650705, "height": 0.012398460880718276, "width": 0.5701330108827085}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {"risk_factor": ["The Domino\u2019s Pizza brand and the Group\u2019s reputation are critical to its business"]}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-25-5", "text": "The Group\u2019s reputation and the quality of the Domino\u2019s Pizza brand are critical to its business and success and\nthe Group\u2019s business could be negatively affected if either of them is harmed.

The rights of shareholders in the Company under Directive 2004/25/EC on\ntakeover bids may be adversely affected to the extent that agreement is not reached on the sharing of\njurisdiction between the UK Takeover Code and the Dutch Public Offer Rules which could mean that a\ntakeover of the Company is implemented without a bidder being required to offer the investor protection\ncurrently granted to Shareholders (please see paragraph 12.4 of Part 14 \u201cAdditional Information\u2014Legal\nconsiderations of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the European Union\u2014Public offer rules\u201d).\nAlthough it is too early to predict the outcome of the negotiations around Brexit, no assurance can be given\naround the interplay between regulation in the United Kingdom and the European Union and any adverse\nchanges to such interplay could adversely affect Shareholders\u2019 rights and ultimately trading in the Shares.\n", "page_number": 47, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.4681487815305686, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.7387772552372809, "height": 0.2706284737067123, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 7, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-47-7", "text": "43\n", "page_number": 47, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4879081015719468, "top_left_y": 0.9264643009833262, "lower_right_x": 0.5078597339782346, "lower_right_y": 0.937152629328773, "height": 0.010688328345446751, "width": 0.019951632406287778}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-48-0", "text": "                    PART 2\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION\n", "page_number": 48, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.2460701330108827, "top_left_y": 0.0645575032064985, "lower_right_x": 0.749093107617896, "lower_right_y": 0.09576742197520308, "height": 0.031209918768704575, "width": 0.5030229746070134}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-48-1", "text": "General", "page_number": 48, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11608222490931076, "top_left_y": 0.10560068405301411, "lower_right_x": 0.17714631197097944, "lower_right_y": 0.11628901239846089, "height": 0.01068832834544678, "width": 0.06106408706166867}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-48-2", "text": "Investors should rely only on the information in this Prospectus.

These measures are also used by the Group\u2019s management in order to monitor and manage\nfinancial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, non-recurring income/expense, Net Debt, adjusted Net\nDebt and adjusted Net Income/(Loss) alone do not provide a sufficient basis to compare the Group\u2019s\nperformance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\noperating income or any other measure as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash\ngenerated from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be used\ninstead of, or considered as an alternative to, the Group\u2019s historical financial results as reported in the Financial\nInformation. The Group presented these non-IFRS measures because it believes they are helpful to investors\nand financial analysts in highlighting trends in the Group\u2019s overall business, as well as to management in\nmaking decisions about the Group\u2019s business. In addition, investors should be aware that the Group is likely to\nincur other expenses it considers to be non-recurring in the future. The Group\u2019s presentation of Adjusted\nEBITDA should not be construed as an implication that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-\nrecurring items. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in\nexcluding them.

The\nnumber of OHD outlets per 1,000 persons, which stands for capacity of the supply side, is also lower in the\nGroup\u2019s markets than in most other countries in the peer set, suggesting significant upside potential coming\nfrom supply and demand.\n", "page_number": 57, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.19153484395040615, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.34031637451902524, "height": 0.1487815305686191, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-57-3", "text": "OHD Market Value and Footprint, 2015\nUS dollars / purchase power parity\n", "page_number": 57, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11608222490931076, "top_left_y": 0.3552800342026507, "lower_right_x": 0.4207980652962515, "lower_right_y": 0.3830696879008123, "height": 0.02778965369816161, "width": 0.3047158403869408}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-57-4", "text": "2,500\n            OHD Spending per Capita                                                             Spain\n\n2,000\n                                                                                   Italy\n                                                                                                                OHD market size\n                                               USA                                                                 (2015)\n1,500\n\n                                                                                       Brazil                   Sample size =$100\n1,000                                     France\n                                                             Czech Republic\n                            Israel                                                                      China\n                                                   Germany\n 500                                                                     Hungary\n                       Poland        Turkey\n                   Russia            India\n                                                                                                    # of Outlets / 000s People\n   0\n        0                             2                              4                          6                             8\n", "page_number": 57, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.39290294997862335, "lower_right_x": 0.8796856106408706, "lower_right_y": 0.5805899957246686, "height": 0.18768704574604528, "width": 0.7593712212817412}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-57-5", "text": "Source: Group\u2019s estimates for Turkey OHD market size (based on data and information obtained from the professional organisations\nreferred to in Part 2 \u201cPresentation of Financial and Other Information\u2014Market, economic and industry data\u201d); Euromonitor International;\nConsumer Foodservice 2017; EIU via S&P Global Market Intelligence\n", "page_number": 57, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.589140658401026, "lower_right_x": 0.8845223700120919, "lower_right_y": 0.6284737067122702, "height": 0.03933304831124418, "width": 0.7690447400241838}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-57-6", "text": "The potential of OHD markets in the Group\u2019s countries of presence is highlighted by population characteristics\nin those countries.

This trend is expected to continue in the future.\n\u2022   Increase in the rate of employment. Full-time employees are the primary seekers of quick service dining\n    options (for instance, for lunchtime meals and late night delivery), and are also likely to receive sufficient\n    remuneration to afford out-of-home dining. According to Turkstat, the number of employed persons in\n    Turkey has increased from 20 million in 2010 to 24 million in 2015, implying a CAGR of approximately\n    four per cent., above population growth (1.7% CAGR over the same period according to the EIU data via\n    S&P Global Market Intelligence). Near-term trends in population dynamics and increasing participation of\n    women in the workforce can be expected to further drive volume increase in this customer segment.\n\u2022   Increase in disposable income levels. As a function of favourable macroeconomic environment and\n    increase in employment, disposable income, which is a primary driver of OHD spending, has increased.\n    The cumulative annual growth rate in disposable incomes was 12.1% between 2010 and 2015 (increase\n    from TRY10.6 thousand per capita per annum in 2010 to TRY18.8 thousand in 2015 as per the EIU data\n    via S&P Global Market Intelligence).\n\u2022   Increase in the number of middle-income households. According to Euromonitor International, this number\n    has increased from 6,083 thousand households in 2010 to 6,626 thousand in 2015, representing a CAGR\n    of two per cent. In this context, the middle class is defined as the number of households with between\n    75% and 125% of median income.\n\u2022   Increase in the number of university students. Students require quick and affordable dining options, and\n    are therefore often attracted to fast-food meals. According to YOK, the number of students has increased\n    from 3.5 million in 2010 to 6.7 million in 2015, implying a CAGR of approximately 14% and reflecting\n    increasing demand for higher education as the economy becomes more service-oriented.\n\u2022   Decrease in average household size and increase in number of single households. At a similar absolute\n    level of disposable income, smaller households allow for increased spending per person, thus making\n    dining out/food delivery relatively more affordable for family budgets. According to EIU and BMI,\n    between 2010 and 2016 the average household size in Turkey has decreased from 3.84 to 3.74 persons,\n    implying a cumulative rate of decline of approximately (0.5%), projected to further decrease to 3.71 by\n    2020. According to Turkstat, the number of single households has increased from 1.5 million in 2010 to\n    3.1 million in 2015, representing a CAGR of 16% over the same period and fuelling demand for delivery\n    options.\n", "page_number": 62, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.11244121419410004, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.5955536554082942, "height": 0.48311244121419417, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-62-2", "text": "On the supply side, growth is benefitting from a low base effect given the low penetration of the OHD segment\nin Turkey overall and in areas with low concentration of population and limited purchasing power.

While\nstill sensitive to GDP fluctuations, the chained part of the fast-food segment has been growing at or above real\nGDP growth rates, supported by attractive pricing and increased demand for affordable dining options. As an\naffordable and satiating meal offering substantial variety, pizza is an important category within fast-food, and as\nof 2015 represented approximately seven per cent. of the overall OHD market and was equivalent to 16% of\nthe fast-food market (compared to three per cent. of OHD market and 18% of the fast-food market in Turkey as\nof 2015, as per the Group\u2019s estimates based on data and information obtained from the professional\norganisations referred to in Part 2 \u201cPresentation of Financial and Other Information\u2014Market, economic and\nindustry data\u201d).

Chained players, who have been steadily increasing their share of the pizza market,\naccounted for only 20% of sales in the pizza market in 2016, according to Group\u2019s estimates.

Based on this, the business development team conducts sales potential analyses (average weekly\nunit sales, store-level EBITDA and payback period on initial investment) during which territorial intelligence,\nregional and community acceptance and traffic information (for example, closest restaurants, competition and\ntraffic generators) are taken into consideration to determine likely street preferences. Correct mapping is critical\nto ensure customer commitment as a result of the Group\u2019s 30-minute delivery guarantee. Each store is allocated\na distinct map for delivery.

Directly, or through the custodian, the Depositary will hold the beneficial title to the Shares on trust\nfor participating members to whom it will issue the dematerialised Depositary Interests. The Depositary\nInterests will be created pursuant to and issued on the terms of a deed poll executed by the Depositary in\nfavour of the holders of the Depositary Interests from time to time (the \u201cDeed Poll\u201d).

The Depositary Interests will be\ncapable of being traded and settlement will be within the CREST system in the same way as any other CREST\nsecurities. If a DI holder wishes itself to hold legal title to the Share represented by its Depositary Interest, it\nmay request that the relevant Depositary Interest is removed from CREST and that it is recorded in the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders register. In order to achieve this, the Share shall have to be transferred to the DI\nholder through a written instrument and acknowledgement of the transfer by, or the service of a deed of transfer\non, the Company pursuant to Section 2:86c of the Dutch Civil Code.

DPIF may terminate the Russian MFA upon breach of the Russian MFA or breach,\n    resulting in termination, of a related store franchise agreement. This includes failure to pay when due the\n    royalty fee or advertising fee payable under the Russian MFA.\n(c) Effect of termination. Upon the expiration or termination of the Russian MFA, Russian OpCo is required\n    to cease immediately its Domino\u2019s Pizza operations although, subject as set out below, each separate store\n    franchise agreement relating to stores owned or controlled by Russian OpCo shall remain in force for the\n    remainder of the 10 year term for such agreement and subject to the terms of the store franchise\n    agreement, the same may be renewed for a further ten years. If, however, the reason for termination of the\n    Russian MFA is the breach of its terms by Russian OpCo, then, DPIF will additionally have the option to\n    purchase at its discretion, all the assets associated with all or any of the stores and commissaries owned by\n    Russian OpCo or all of the existing issued share capital of Russian OpCo, in which case the relative\n    franchise agreement for each store owned by Russian OpCo will be terminated. The purchase price for the\n    store assets is based on a percentage of its store sales during the 12 months preceding the date of\n    termination. The purchase price for the commissary assets is based on net book value. Immediately prior\n    to the expiration or termination of the Russian MFA for any reason, Russian OpCo is required, at DPIF\u2019s\n    option, execute an assignment to DPIF or its designee of all right, title and interest in and to the\n    sub-franchise agreements with sub-franchisees of Russian OpCo.\n(d) Store opening. Russian OpCo is obliged to notify DPIF of any new store opening once the relevant\n    corporate or franchised store has been opened. If Russian OpCo is at any time in breach of the Russian\n    MFA, DPIF is entitled to require that its pre-approval is sought. Once a store is opened, a royalty fee is\n    payable to DPIF for stores opened and operated by Russian OpCo and franchised stores. In turn, Russian\n    OpCo can charge a store opening fee to a sub-franchisee. With respect to franchised stores, if Russian\n    OpCo charges a royalty fee over a certain percentage, the excess over such percentage is then split\n    between DPIF and Russian OpCo.\n(e) Advertising fund. Russian OpCo is obliged to pay an advertising fee in relation to weekly sales into a\n    separate advertising fund.\n(f) Store franchise agreements. Russian OpCo is required to comply with the Russian MFA and the provisions\n    of each store franchise agreement relating to stores opened and operated by Russian OpCo. In addition it\n    will be required to use its best endeavours to ensure that each of its sub-franchisees complies with their\n    store franchise agreements with Russian OpCo. Each store franchise agreement with sub-franchisees must\n    be in a form approved in writing by DPIF. Russian OpCo is obliged to diligently recruit suitable\n    sub-franchisees in Russia.\n(g) Training. Russian OpCo is obliged to provide adequate training and support for managers and employees\n    of stores owned or operated by it. The training support provided by Russian OpCo to its sub-franchisees is\n    required to be similar to training provided to its corporate stores.\n", "page_number": 185, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.24925181701581872, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.8926891834117144, "height": 0.6434373663958957, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-185-3", "text": "181\n", "page_number": 185, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4879081015719468, "top_left_y": 0.9264643009833262, "lower_right_x": 0.5126964933494559, "lower_right_y": 0.937152629328773, "height": 0.010688328345446751, "width": 0.024788391777509078}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-186-0", "text": "(h) Names and marks.

The Russian MFA contains operating requirements imposed on Russian OpCo\n      and the stores it operates. These include the notification to DPIF of corporate and franchised store\n      openings, new sub-franchisees and advertising and promotional materials. If Russian OpCo is at any time\n      in breach of the Russia MFA, DPIF is entitled to require that Russian OpCo seek pre-approval with\n      respect to each of the aforementioned matters. Russian OpCo is additionally required to diligently recruit\n      sub-franchisees and, once recruited, to use its best endeavours to ensure that the sub-franchisees comply\n      with their obligations owed to Russian OpCo. Russian OpCo is also responsible for the compliance of its\n      sub-franchisees with all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on them in their capacity as\n      sub-franchisees, with respect to occupational health and safety, consumer protection, trade regulation,\n      workers compensation, insurance, and the payment of all associated withholding and income taxes in\n      connection with the operation of a franchised store. Russian OpCo monitors its obligations in this respect\n      so that any non-compliance by a sub-franchisee may be cured through working with the sub-franchisee or\n      the relationship terminated in order not to prejudice relations with DPIF.\n(j)   Commissary. DPIF irrevocably agrees to grant Russian OpCo the right to establish a commissary or\n      commissaries to be owned and operated by Russian OpCo, for the purpose of supplying food products and\n      ingredients, beverage products and other supplies and materials for sale to consumers, to all the stores in\n      Russia.

The Group has assessed the performance of its stores and has not identified any events or changes in\ncircumstances indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as of 31 December 2016.\n", "page_number": 224, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.6117999144933732, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.7114151346729372, "height": 0.09961522017956392, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 8, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-224-8", "text": "A-24\n", "page_number": 224, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4782345828295042, "top_left_y": 0.9264643009833262, "lower_right_x": 0.5169286577992744, "lower_right_y": 0.937152629328773, "height": 0.010688328345446751, "width": 0.03869407496977023}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-225-0", "text": "(Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TRY) unless otherwise stated.)\n", "page_number": 225, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1946795646916566, "top_left_y": 0.0645575032064985, "lower_right_x": 0.8029020556227328, "lower_right_y": 0.07823856348867037, "height": 0.013681060282171864, "width": 0.6082224909310762}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-225-1", "text": "NOTE 10\u2014INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n", "page_number": 225, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.10560068405301411, "lower_right_x": 0.38210399032648124, "lower_right_y": 0.11714407866609662, "height": 0.011543394613082514, "width": 0.2666263603385731}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-225-2", "text": "                                                                                                  Currency\n                                                            1 January                            translation   31 December\n                                                               2016     Additions   Disposals   adjustments        2016\nCost\nKey money . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     4,675         13      (1,954)          \u20140)0         2,734\nFranchise contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    48,485         \u20140)0        \u20140)0         \u20140)0        48,485\nComputer software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      10,995      8,217        (116)         406          19,502\n                                                             64,155      8,230      (2,070)         406          70,721\nAccumulated amortisation\nKey money . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

IFRS 16 now requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting\n    future lease payments and a \u201cright-of-use asset\u201d for virtually all lease contracts. At the very least, the new\n    accounting model for lessees is expected to impact negotiations between lessors and lessees. Under\n    IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an\n    identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n", "page_number": 247, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.32791791363830697, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.8512184694313809, "height": 0.5233005557930739, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 8, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-247-8", "text": "A-47\n", "page_number": 247, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4782345828295042, "top_left_y": 0.9264643009833262, "lower_right_x": 0.5175332527206772, "lower_right_y": 0.937152629328773, "height": 0.010688328345446751, "width": 0.03929866989117298}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-248-0", "text": "(Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TRY) unless otherwise stated.)\n", "page_number": 248, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1946795646916566, "top_left_y": 0.0645575032064985, "lower_right_x": 0.8029020556227328, "lower_right_y": 0.07866609662248825, "height": 0.014108593415989745, "width": 0.6082224909310762}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-248-1", "text": "NOTE 2\u2014BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF CONDENSED COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued)\n", "page_number": 248, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.10560068405301411, "lower_right_x": 0.8403869407496977, "lower_right_y": 0.1333903377511757, "height": 0.027789653698161595, "width": 0.7249093107617895}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32", "blob_id": "25c6119c27cbbbd07b60bddfcfbbb7e215efca2ed790f78971b265ce96aa4f32-248-2", "text": "The Group will evaluate the effect of the aforementioned changes within its operations and apply changes\nstarting from effective date.
