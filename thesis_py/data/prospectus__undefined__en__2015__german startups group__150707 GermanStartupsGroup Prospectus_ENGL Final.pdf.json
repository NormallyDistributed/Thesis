An incorrect valuation could result, for example, from\nbeing unaware of significant information at the time of valuation, which would lead to a valuation\nbased on incomplete information or information that is subject to rapid changes. For instance, the\nCompany generally does not have access to audited financial statements from the portfolio com-\npanies. It cannot, moreover, be ruled out that the Company will intentionally be provided with false\ninformation on a portfolio company and will not identify it as such and therefore base its invest-\nment decision on that intentionally false information. However, an incorrect valuation may also\nresult from an erroneous opportunity-risk analysis, for example if estimates and expectations re-\ngarding the economic environment that are of relevance for a portfolio company prove to be false,\nunrealistic or too optimistic in retrospect. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s valuation depends in par-\nticular on whether its co-investors regard the valuation of a portfolio company as appropriate, with\nthe share purchase price paid by the co-investors representing the benchmark for this. The as-\nsessment of the co-investors may, however, prove to be inaccurate and/or deviate from the mar-\nket price objectively attainable by the Company for its investment, particularly as a result of non-\nfinancial motives such as the payment of a strategic premium or the acquisition of a majority\nshareholding. In addition, an incorrect valuation may also occur if, for example, a portfolio compa-\nny does not obtain the necessary follow-up financing or such financing is delayed and the portfolio\ncompany therefore lacks the necessary liquidity, which could lead to the insolvency of the portfolio\ncompany. Furthermore, valuations are made more difficult by the fact that the portfolio companies\nare subject to considerable planning uncertainties given that these companies are young compa-\nnies with young products that are often not yet being offered in established markets. The risk of an\nincorrect valuation can result in an equity interest being acquired at a price that is too high. In ad-\ndition, GSG always measures the minority shareholdings which it holds on the basis of their fair\nvalue in accordance with IFRS when preparing its Annual Financial Statements. If the value of an\nequity interest is incorrectly estimated, the figures contained in the Annual Financial Statements\nwill not reflect the actual net assets or the results of operations of the Company. The risk exists\nthat the investment will have to be written off in full or in part in subsequent years.

They relate to technology for products already marketed; amortisation over ten years\n    was assumed on the basis of the life cycle of the product. The earnings effect after taxes for\n    the first quarter of 2015 was EUR 19k.\n\n(2) The interest expenses in the amount of EUR 23k relate to the theoretical financing costs of\n    the cash payment to be made to the transferor Exozet shareholders plus the financing costs\n    of the payment of the purchase price for the shares acquired on 1 June 2015. The interest\n    expenses taken into account in the first quarter of 2015 include the financing of the cash\n    payment and purchase price payment assumed for the previous year plus the interest ex-\n    penses to be taken into account on a pro rata basis for 2014. An interest rate of 5% per year\n    was assumed for the pro-forma calculation. The earnings effect after taxes for the first quarter\n    of 2015 was EUR 16k.\n\n(3) The share of earnings attributable to minority interests was EUR -139k. It comprises the mi-\n    nority interest share of 49.52% in the Exozet result for the period from 1 January to 31 March\n    2015 in the amount of EUR -130k and in the amount of EUR -9k from the effect on earnings\n    of the hidden reserves attributable to Exozet.\n\n(4) As at the reporting date, there are no potential diluting equity instruments, such as stock op-\n    tions. The diluted and undiluted earnings per share agree and are calculated as a quotient of\n    the profit to which the shareholders of the parent company are entitled in the amount of EUR\n    424,639.86, and of the average pro-forma number of shares issued during the reporting peri-\n    od in the amount of 6,744,500 shares.

The total for\n     these weighted revenues per segment is show under the item \u201cTotal weighted aver-\n     age revenues.\u201d\n", "page_number": 141, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.19347037484885127, "top_left_y": 0.16032492518170158, "lower_right_x": 0.8657799274486094, "lower_right_y": 0.3108165882855921, "height": 0.15049166310389053, "width": 0.6723095525997582}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75", "blob_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75-141-3", "text": "Change in weighted average revenues in 2014 compared with 2013 (Group B):\n", "page_number": 141, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1928657799274486, "top_left_y": 0.324497648567764, "lower_right_x": 0.8155985489721886, "lower_right_y": 0.3381787088499359, "height": 0.01368106028217192, "width": 0.6227327690447401}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75", "blob_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75-141-4", "text": "3.\n", "page_number": 141, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.16384522370012092, "top_left_y": 0.324497648567764, "lower_right_x": 0.1759371221281741, "lower_right_y": 0.3347584437793929, "height": 0.010260795211628926, "width": 0.012091898428053194}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75", "blob_id": "40935c69b53e454044edb00bd9d52d68a5c52669e91c1cf5cbaced92bfcb8f75-141-5", "text": "The changes in revenues between 2013 and 2014 relate to the 15 portfolio companies in\nGroup B that were already formed in 2013 and for which the Company received revenue\nfigures for 2014 and 2013.

Two capital increases were executed in 2012. By a resolution of the Gen-\neral Meeting held on 16 April 2012, registered in the commercial register on 15 May 2012, the\nshare capital was initially raised by EUR 875,000.00 to EUR 925,000.00. By way of the post-\nincorporation with Gerlinger & Partner GmbH and Gerlinger Advisory GmbH (formerly: ATventure\nGmbH), the Company (operating under the name German Startups Group Berlin AG at the time)\nconcluded a non-cash incorporation and acquisition agreement on 11 April 2013, which was ap-\nproved by the General Meeting through a resolution adopted on 17 May 2013. Therefore, of the\nEUR 875,000.00 capital increase approved on 16 April 2012 and registered in the commercial\nregister on 15 May 2012, the sum of EUR 89,990.00 was a contribution in kind and not a cash\ncontribution. By a resolution of the General Meeting held on 4 May 2012, registered in the com-\nmercial register on 2 August 2012, the share capital was again raised, in this case by EUR\n1,107,500.00 to EUR 2,032,500.00. By a resolution of the General Meeting dated 24 July 2012\nand entered in the commercial register on 2 August 2012, the business name was changed to\n\u201cGerman Startups Group Berlin AG\u201d. Two further capital increases took place in 2013, each on the\nbasis of resolutions adopted by the General Meeting of 17 May 2013. In the first instance, the\nshare capital was increased by EUR 1,219,500.00 from EUR 2,032,500.00 to EUR 3,252,000.00\nand entered in the commercial register on 18 July 2013. The second capital increase in 2013 took\nplace on the basis of authorised capital registered in the commercial register on 5 June 2013. In\nthis case, the share capital was increased by EUR 211,500.00 to EUR 3,463,500.00. The capital\nincrease was entered in the commercial register on 4 September 2013. Further capital increases\nwere implemented in 2014 through authorised capital created on 7 February 2014 by a resolution\nof the General Meeting and entered in the commercial register on 13 February 2014.
