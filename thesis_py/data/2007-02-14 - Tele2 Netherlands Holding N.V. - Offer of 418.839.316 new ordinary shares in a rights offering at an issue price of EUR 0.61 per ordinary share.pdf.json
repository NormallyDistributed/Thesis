If a pledgee or usufructarian acquires such\n(conditional) voting rights, this may trigger the reporting obligations for the holder of the shares (or depositary\nreceipts for the shares).\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11064087061668681, "top_left_y": 0.06797776827704147, "lower_right_x": 0.8796856106408706, "lower_right_y": 0.21889696451474988, "height": 0.15091919623770841, "width": 0.7690447400241838}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077", "blob_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077-126-1", "text": "Furthermore, each member of the Management Board and Supervisory Board must immediately give written\nnotice to the AFM by means of a standard form of any change in his or her holding of shares and voting rights in\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11064087061668681, "top_left_y": 0.2321504916631039, "lower_right_x": 0.875453446191052, "lower_right_y": 0.2599401453612655, "height": 0.02778965369816158, "width": 0.7648125755743652}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077", "blob_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077-126-2", "text": "us.\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11064087061668681, "top_left_y": 0.2629328772979906, "lower_right_x": 0.13180169286577992, "lower_right_y": 0.2702009405728944, "height": 0.007268063274903813, "width": 0.021160822249093103}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077", "blob_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077-126-3", "text": "Pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act, which also encompasses the implementation of the Market Abuse\nDirective 2003/6/EC and related Commission Directives 2003/124/EC in Netherlands law, 2003/125/EC and\n2004/72/EC, members of our Management and Supervisory Boards and any other person who has day-to-day\n(co)managerial responsibilities or who has the authority to make decisions affecting our future developments and\nbusiness prospects or who has regularly access to inside information relating, directly or indirectly, to us\n(\u201cPerson\u201d), must notify the AFM of all transactions conducted on his own account relating to our ordinary shares\nor in securities which value is determined by the value of our ordinary shares.\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11064087061668681, "top_left_y": 0.2868747327917914, "lower_right_x": 0.875453446191052, "lower_right_y": 0.3830696879008123, "height": 0.09619495510902093, "width": 0.7648125755743652}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077", "blob_id": "1303c02c7ff0445b8e9e6a8becc950235e2cc7be35e6d6c72c4ab72dedb51077-126-4", "text": "In addition, persons designated by the governmental decree pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act dated\n12 October 2006 (Besluit Marktmisbruik Wft) (the \u201cMarket Abuse Decree\u201d) who are closely associated with our\nmembers of the Management Board, Supervisory Board or any of the Persons (as described above), must notify\nthe AFM of the existence of any transactions conducted on their own account relating to our ordinary shares or\nsecurities the value of which is determined by the value of our ordinary shares.

The consolidated statement of operations data has been re-presented\n    in order to reflect the operations of Versatel Deutschland as discontinued operations. Under IFRS the results of discontinued operations\n    (if material and distinct) are presented on the face of the statement of operations as a single amount comprising the net result of the\n    discontinued operation. This requires separate reporting of net profit from continuing operations and the net profit from discontinued\n    operations, with comparative statement of operations data re-presented if in the current period an activity qualifies as discontinued. IFRS\n    5 requires a component of an entity to be classified as discontinued when the criteria to be classified as held for sale have been met or it\n    has been disposed of. Such a component represents a major line of business or geographical area of operations or it is a subsidiary acquired\n    exclusively with a view to resale.\n\n\n\n4.

At the end of December 2005 the Company reached a covenant with the tax authorities covering\nfiscal years up to and including 2002. The covenant settles a number of issues that had been outstanding. In\nparticular, in conjunction with the tax bill it provides certainty on the application of article 12 CITA 1969 in 2002.\nIn concrete terms, the covenant and tax bill have decreased the Company\u2019s deferred tax liability position by \u20ac116\nmillion. The release of the deferred tax liability was added to the Company\u2019s equity where it was originally\nformed.

Versatel made an agreement with the Dutch tax authorities on the treatment\nof the financial restructuring.

We allocate our revenues to the period in which the traffic was generated.\nThe composition of our customer base, service offerings and geographical focus has continued to evolve as a result\nof the further development of our network, acquisitions, including Svianed, Versatel West-Deutschland (formerly\nknown as VEW Telnet) and Versatel Nord-Deutschland (formerly known as Komtel), Versatel S\u00fcd-Deutschland\n(formerly known as tesion) and Versatel Germany (formerly known as Completel) and most recently Versatel\nBerlin (formally known as BerliKomm) and the expansion of our product offering. As a result of these\nacquisitions, we have significantly increased the portion of our revenues generated from fixed monthly fees,\nexpanded our geographical focus in Germany and expanded our customer base to include larger customers.\n\nHistorically, we have priced our variable communications services (voice) at a discount to the local PTTs and\nexpect to continue this pricing strategy as we expand our operations. In general, prices for communications\nservices have decreased over the last several years, both for voice traffic as well as for data and internet services.\nThese price reductions have an adverse impact on margins. Our data and internet services continue to be priced at\ncompetitive market levels, but are less influenced by the pricing power of the incumbent operators.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenues is attributable to fixed monthly fees, primarily through the provision of data\nand internet services such as internet connectivity, local area network to local area network (\u201cLAN-to-LAN\u201d)\ninterconnect services and internet web-hosting. For the year ended 31 December 2004, 47.3% of our revenues\nwere generated from the provision of data and internet services. Our variable revenues are generated by minutes\nof communications billed for voice telephony services originated by our customers, terminating voice telephony\ntraffic to customers directly connected with our network and the termination of dial-up internet traffic onto our\nnetwork for both Zon, (per 2005 renamed Versatel Consumer), and other internet service providers. Our consumer\ninternet division, previously named \u2018Zon\u2019, generates revenues from the termination of minutes of traffic onto our\nnetwork as described above, selling advertising on our portals and to a lesser extent receiving a percentage of some\nof the e-commerce revenue generated by our subscribers. Additionally, Zon generates revenues by providing\nbroadband internet access and voice services over DSL technology for a fixed monthly fee. As of August 2005,\nwe plan to generate additional revenues by providing triple-play services.\n\nWe also make a distinction between revenues generated through customers that are directly connected to our\nnetwork (commonly referred to as \u201con-net\u201d revenues), and revenues generated through customers that are not\ndirectly connected to our network (commonly referred to as \u201coff-net\u201d- customers). On-net customers can be\nconnected to our website through our own fiber, DSL technology, other copper access technologies, wireless\ntechnologies or leased lines. For the year ended 31 December 2004, \u20ac446.4 million of our revenue was generated\nfrom on-net customers.\n\nVersatel\u2019s revenues presented on a geographical basis are divided as follows:\n\n(\u20ac thousands)                                                                                                           2004      2003\n\nNetherlands ....................................................................................................        266,928   225,449\nGermany.........................................................................................................        273,740   189,633\nBelgium ..........................................................................................................       60,011    47,057\n\nTotal................................................................................................................   600,679   462,139\n\nHistorically, we generated our revenues from small- and medium-sized business customers.
