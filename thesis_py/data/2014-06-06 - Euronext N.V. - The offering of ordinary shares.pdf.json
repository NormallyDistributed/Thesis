In connection with the\n         demerger of LIFFE from Euronext and the intended separation of Euronext from ICE via a carve out of\n         the continental European operations of NYSE Euronext into an independent, publicly traded company\n         by means of an initial public offering (the \u201cSeparation\u201d), we entered into a service level agreement\n         (\u201cSLA\u201d) with ICE providing for the reduction and eventual termination of the IT services provided by\n         the Group once LIFFE has completed its migration to another technology platform. We expect the\n         LIFFE IT services to be discontinued by the end of 2014, and we have already announced certain\n         restructuring actions affecting our IT function.

Our historical\n         combined financial results reflect allocations of expenses, pursuant to transfer pricing agreements, for\n         services historically provided by NYSE Euronext and ICE. The historical transfer pricing agreements\n         provided for the allocation of shared costs, including (i) global corporate management and support\n         functions in Europe and the United States, (ii) various IT services (e.g., data centre, global UTP\n         software development costs and research and development) in continental Europe, the United Kingdom\n         and the United States and (iii) allocation of all operating expenses within each Legacy Euronext\n         business unit to the local exchange entities, including LIFFE.

Estimated derivatives clearing revenue and\n    estimated derivatives clearing expenses are non-IFRS measures and are not audited. Estimated derivatives\n    clearing revenue should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, and should be read\n    in conjunction with, reported revenues. Please see \u201cImportant Information\u2014Presentation of Financial\n    Information\u2014Non-IFRS Financial Measures\u201d.\n(2) We will retain all shared internal information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) resources that support the derivatives\n    markets operated by both the Group and LIFFE. In our combined financial statements included in this\n    Prospectus, derivatives IT costs have been allocated between the local exchange entities in proportion to\n    their respective derivatives trading revenue. Accordingly, the recharge to LIFFE of allocated IT costs plus\n    mark-up is reflected as related party revenue. In connection with the demerger of LIFFE from Euronext and\n    the separation of Euronext from ICE, we entered into a service level agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d) with ICE providing\n    for the reduction and eventual termination of the IT services provided by the Group once LIFFE has\n    completed its migration to another technology platform. Substantially all of this related party revenue is\n    therefore anticipated to be non-recurring after the year ending 31 December 2014. The costs used as a basis\n    to generate the related party billing and revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 are primarily\n    allocated fixed costs arising from shared resources, rather than directly attributable costs. Consequently, we\n    do not expect these costs to be representative of the costs that will be eliminated when the LIFFE IT services\n    are terminated. As of 31 December 2013 we had already announced a restructuring of our London-based IT\n    operations, which are primarily supporting the LIFFE exchange and our derivatives trading business.\n(3) Adjusted and estimated total revenue is a non-IFRS measure and is not audited. Adjusted and estimated total\n    revenue should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, and should be read in\n    conjunction with, reported revenues. Because substantially all of the related party revenue under the SLA\n    with ICE described above is anticipated to be non-recurring after the year ending 31 December 2014, we\n    believe adjusted and estimated total revenue provides a meaningful indicator of what our revenue would\n    have been for the periods presented as a stand-alone entity and assuming that the Derivatives Clearing\n    Agreement had been in effect from 1 January 2013.

Fees generated by corporate customers increased to \u20ac41 million (annual fees: \u20ac20 million;\n    admission and other listing fees: \u20ac21 million) compared to \u20ac40 million for the year ended\n    31 December 2011 (annual fees: \u20ac21 million; admission and other listing fees: \u20ac19 million). Fees\n    generated by ETFs and warrants decreased to \u20ac20 million (annual fees: \u20ac14 million; admission fees: \u20ac6\n    million) from \u20ac23 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 (annual fees: \u20ac15 million; admission\n    fees: \u20ac8 million).\n\u2022   Cash trading revenue decreased by 26% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011, principally as\n    a result of lower trading volumes, which were 16% lower than the prior year, and an 11% lower\n    average fee per trade. The decrease in cash trading volumes was largely attributable to weaker\n    macroeconomic conditions in Europe in 2012 compared to 2011, including market uncertainty resulting\n    from the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, as well as the implementation of the French FTT. The\n    decrease in the average fee per trade was largely the result of minor fee changes, a shift in the mix\n    between the different types of trading flow and the change in the average trade size, which also affects\n    the fee per trade.\n\u2022   Derivatives trading revenue decreased by 33% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011,\n    principally as a result of lower volumes in lots, which decreased by 23% compared to the prior year,\n    and a 13% lower average fee per lot. Volumes in equity options trading, which constitute\n    approximately half of total derivatives trading volume, decreased by 28% compared to the prior year,\n    primarily as a result of a loss in market share. The decrease in the average fee per lot was mainly\n    driven by fee changes on equity options and index options products. We faced competition both from\n    new entrants into our markets as well as from existing market participants such as banks and liquidity\n    providers that sponsored new initiatives. We faced increased pressure on pricing and market share, in\n    particular from new entrants that have fee structures significantly lower than ours. Banks and brokers\n    increasingly assumed the role of principal and acted as counterparty to orders originating from their\n    customers, thus \u201cinternalising\u201d order flow that would otherwise have been transacted on one of our\n    exchanges. Banks and brokers also entered into bilateral trading arrangements by matching their order\n    flows, depriving our exchanges of trading volumes.\n\u2022   Post-trade revenue decreased by 5% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011. The decrease was\n    primarily attributable to changes in the fee book that came into effect as at 1 January 2012, as well as a\n    decrease in revenues from the Real Time Settlement System.\n\u2022   Market solutions & other revenue increased by 25% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011,\n    largely due to contracts signed with new customers in the year ended 31 December 2012.\n", "page_number": 88, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1560798548094374, "top_left_y": 0.13980333475844378, "lower_right_x": 0.8856624319419237, "lower_right_y": 0.6498503634031637, "height": 0.51004702864472, "width": 0.7295825771324863}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1", "blob_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1-88-3", "text": "      For the year ended 31 December 2012, 60.4% of our third party revenue was generated from our businesses\nin France, 25.8% from the Netherlands, 8.3% from Portugal, 4.9% from Belgium and 0.6% from the UK.

While the core trading system is built on this order-driven\nprinciple, the flexibility of the UTP enables us to develop different types of matching algorithms and\nfunctionalities to suit the different price formation mechanisms that exist amongst the different cash asset classes.\nThe UTP also enables us to cater for different market participant needs, for example we built the retail matching\nfacility in order to bring to retail brokers an additional layer of liquidity specifically aimed at offering price\nimprovement for less informed retail order flow. The UTP\u2019s flexible structure enables us to integrate this\nliquidity directly into the central order book. We also have developed a supplemental liquidity provider\nprogramme, which aims at improving market quality. Our cash markets continue to yield the best market quality\nmetrics amongst our competitors. These metrics include amongst others, spread, market depth, best price setting\nand presence time at the best bid and offer spread. The programme encompasses both a presence time obligation\nat the best bid and offer spread and a minimum passive volume obligation. This volume obligation is of\nparticular interest as, in combination with the presence time obligation, creates order persistence and therefore\nincreases probability of execution. In a fragmented trading environment, market quality metrics are actively used\nby trading firms as decision making parameters embedded in their order routing systems and therefore contribute\nto maintaining our market share.\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11554748941318814, "top_left_y": 0.061137238135955535, "lower_right_x": 0.8856624319419237, "lower_right_y": 0.2907225309961522, "height": 0.22958529286019666, "width": 0.7701149425287356}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1", "blob_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1-126-1", "text": "Trading Members\n", "page_number": 126, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1161524500907441, "top_left_y": 0.3108165882855921, "lower_right_x": 0.23714458560193588, "lower_right_y": 0.324497648567764, "height": 0.013681060282171864, "width": 0.12099213551119178}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1", "blob_id": "35824e6d5ee4cde8a42cd4bb159fed9886912b7a830c9c3d68f68feb457662f1-126-2", "text": "     As at 31 March 2014, Euronext had 203 direct trading members on its cash business, compared to 217\nmembers as at 31 December 2012 and 214 members as at 31 December 2011.

Consequently, management expects this related party revenue to be non-recurring and has\n    announced a restructuring of its London-based IT operations, which are primarily supporting the Liffe\n    exchange and the Group\u2019s own Derivatives trading business.\n(b) For the quarter ended 31 March 2013, related party revenue and expenses reflect cross-charges to and\n    from the US operations of the Parent, made in accordance with a global R&D cost-sharing agreement.\n    Pursuant to this agreement, global UTP software development costs are shared in proportion to\n    revenues.
