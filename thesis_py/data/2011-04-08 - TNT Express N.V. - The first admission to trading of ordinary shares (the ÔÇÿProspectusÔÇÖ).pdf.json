The decline in international volumes continued into the first half of 2009 (versus the\ncomparatively strong first half of 2008) but the decline in growth slowed and flattened towards the end of\n2009.\n", "page_number": 71, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09195402298850575, "top_left_y": 0.6220607097050022, "lower_right_x": 0.8850574712643678, "lower_right_y": 0.7114151346729372, "height": 0.089354424967935, "width": 0.7931034482758621}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 10, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-71-10", "text": "Revenue-quality\n", "page_number": 71, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.7315091919623771, "lower_right_x": 0.22020568663036902, "lower_right_y": 0.7451902522445489, "height": 0.013681060282171864, "width": 0.12885662431941924}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 11, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-71-11", "text": "Revenue quality declined in 2009 versus 2008 driven by competitive pressure on prices, the shift in\nproduct mix from express to economy products, and the reduction in the weight per consignment.\n", "page_number": 71, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.7588713125267208, "lower_right_x": 0.8808227465214761, "lower_right_y": 0.7900812312954254, "height": 0.031209918768704603, "width": 0.7894736842105263}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 12, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-71-12", "text": "Compared to 2007, volumes started to decline in the second half of 2008 throughout the first half of 2009.\nExpress and its competitors found it increasingly difficult to use the available capacity in its networks,\nwhich led to strong pressure on the prices charged for both express and economy services.

However,\na German Shareholder may escape such taxation of undistributed earnings if he held less than 1% of the\nissued share capital of the Company and can either show to the satisfaction of the German tax authorities\nthat (1) less than 90% of the Company's income is passive portfolio income or (2) that regular and\nsubstantial trading in the Company's main class of shares takes place at a recognised stock exchange.\n", "page_number": 134, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.5262932877297991, "lower_right_x": 0.8856624319419237, "lower_right_y": 0.7563061137238136, "height": 0.2300128259940145, "width": 0.794313369630974}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 7, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-134-7", "text": "Inheritance and Gift Tax\n", "page_number": 134, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.7725523728088927, "lower_right_x": 0.28977616454930427, "lower_right_y": 0.7858058999572467, "height": 0.013253527148354038, "width": 0.19842710223835447}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 8, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-134-8", "text": "In general, German inheritance or gift tax with respect to a transfer of Ordinary Shares will only arise, if,\nin the case of inheritance tax, the decedent or the beneficiary, or, in the case of gift tax, the donor or the\nreceiver, is a resident of Germany or if the Ordinary Shares are attributable to a German trade or business\nfor which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in\nGermany.

Both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of TNT have approved all required\ndecisions for the proposed demerger.

Mail is faced with a continuously\ndeclining mail market in the Netherlands and has to focus on sustaining solid cash flows and operational\nefficiency. The priorities for Express are to grow its existing strong European networks, continue to grow the\nintercontinental business from and to Europe into adjacent markets and to secure contributions from its\nexisting strong positions in China, South America and India.

The amendment does not have a material\n    impact on the Express financial statements, as borrowing costs of qualifying assets were already\n    capitalised. The extent of capitalised borrowing cost is limited given the nature of Express'\n    operations and relatively low level of construction in progress.\n", "page_number": 195, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.0955837870538415, "top_left_y": 0.12612227447627192, "lower_right_x": 0.9098608590441621, "lower_right_y": 0.5917058572039333, "height": 0.4655835827276614, "width": 0.8142770719903206}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-195-2", "text": "0081747-0000173 AMCO:3942079.2\n", "page_number": 195, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09316394434361766, "top_left_y": 0.9499786233433091, "lower_right_x": 0.3194192377495463, "lower_right_y": 0.9576742197520308, "height": 0.00769559640872175, "width": 0.22625529340592862}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-195-3", "text": "196\n", "page_number": 195, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.48941318814277074, "top_left_y": 0.950406156477127, "lower_right_x": 0.5130066545674531, "lower_right_y": 0.9572466866182129, "height": 0.0068405301410858765, "width": 0.023593466424682352}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-196-0", "text": "NOTES TO THE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n", "page_number": 196, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09195402298850575, "top_left_y": 0.09533988884138521, "lower_right_x": 0.8324258923169994, "lower_right_y": 0.10944848225737494, "height": 0.014108593415989731, "width": 0.7404718693284936}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-196-1", "text": "1 Intangible assets: 1,892 million (2009: 1,853, 2008: 1,752)\nStatement of changes\n                                                          Goodwill    Software Other intangibles      Total\nAmortisation percentage                                              10%- 35%         0%- 35%\nHistorical cost                                           1,951          332                70      2,353\nAccumulated amortisation and impairments                   (373)        (175)              (11)      (559)\nBalance at 31 December 2007                               1,578          157                59      1,794\nChanges in 2008\nAdditions                                                        3         42                  10         55\nDisposals                                                    -

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of\naccounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements.\n", "page_number": 256, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09195402298850575, "top_left_y": 0.5946985891406584, "lower_right_x": 0.9001814882032668, "lower_right_y": 0.728516460025652, "height": 0.13381787088499353, "width": 0.8082274652147611}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 10, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-256-10", "text": "We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\naudit opinion.\n", "page_number": 256, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.73492945703292, "lower_right_x": 0.8898971566848155, "lower_right_y": 0.7661393758016246, "height": 0.031209918768704603, "width": 0.7985480943738658}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 11, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-256-11", "text": "Opinion\n", "page_number": 256, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09195402298850575, "top_left_y": 0.7729799059427106, "lower_right_x": 0.1693889897156685, "lower_right_y": 0.7900812312954254, "height": 0.017101325352714802, "width": 0.07743496672716274}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 12, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-256-12", "text": "In our opinion, the accompanying combined financial statements as set out on pages 174 to 256 present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Express business of TNT N.V. as at 31 December\n2010, 2009 and 2008 and of its results and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n", "page_number": 256, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09074410163339383, "top_left_y": 0.7930739632321505, "lower_right_x": 0.9001814882032668, "lower_right_y": 0.8482257374946558, "height": 0.05515177426250528, "width": 0.809437386569873}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {"gaas": ["in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union."]}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 13, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-256-13", "text": "Emphasis of matter\n", "page_number": 256, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.09134906231094979, "top_left_y": 0.8580589995724669, "lower_right_x": 0.25650332728372655, "lower_right_y": 0.8730226592560923, "height": 0.014963659683625452, "width": 0.16515426497277674}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 14, "document_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369", "blob_id": "3bd7cac0fac4344cc907bc4ca277730169bd13d59ee688dde1ac504f29878369-256-14", "text": "Emphasis of matter\nWe draw attention to the basis of preparation of the combined financial statements on pages 179 to 182.
