In addition, it does not reflect any historical expense incurred during the period related to the liabilities assumed\n      from Sara Lee as this expense is not expected to be ongoing.\n      We expect to recognize \u20ac5.5 million for non-recurring expenses related to the accelerated vesting of stock based awards and f\n      associated with the bridge financing. Additionally, we have not reflected a pro forma adjustment for the estimated increased\n      corporate overhead and stranded costs or cost savings that we have disclosed elsewhere in this prospectus.

However the actual amounts may vary from these\n      estimates. While management has made its best estimate in determining the amounts disclosed, management is not able to\n      factually support a computation of these amounts.

These weighted average shares were adjusted to exclude certain stock\n      based awards that were deferred as of the respective period ends and which are expected to be satisfied in shares of Sara Lee\n      common stock after separation, and correspondingly, would not result in the issuance of DutchCo ordinary shares.

The total amount allocated to us by Sara Lee was \u20ac17.6 million, \u20ac12.0 million, \u20ac25.4 million, \u20ac23.7 million and\n    \u20ac27.0 million in the first half fiscal 2012 and 2011 and in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Based on current financial plans our\n    management estimates that our total corporate overhead costs will be approximately \u20ac43 million on an annual basis afte\n    separation.

A higher than anticipated effective tax rate could have a\n    adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for purposes of the combined financial\n    statements, we have assumed all taxes were settled by Sara Lee, and as result there are no cash taxes reflected in our\n    operating cash flows. Consequently, our future operating cash flows will be reduced by tax payments which are reflecte\n    as distributions to Sara Lee in financing activities in the combined statement of cash flow.\n\n                                                          66\n", "page_number": 73, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.10764705882352942, "top_left_y": 0.5959090909090909, "lower_right_x": 0.9411764705882353, "lower_right_y": 0.9218181818181819, "height": 0.3259090909090909, "width": 0.8335294117647059}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 11, "document_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c", "blob_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c-73-11", "text": "", "page_number": 73, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4888235294117647, "top_left_y": 0.9413636363636364, "lower_right_x": 0.5070588235294118, "lower_right_y": 0.9527272727272728, "height": 0.011363636363636354, "width": 0.018235294117647072}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c", "blob_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c-74-0", "text": "\u2022   We have historically provided financing to Sara Lee.

The price increases were partially offset by an increase in trade promotions of \u20ac56.1 million, primarily\nthe retail segments, in response to increased competition and market pressures. Our sales were also positively impacted by the sales\nour L\u2019OR EspressO single-serve capsule in our Retail\u2014Western Europe segment, which increased sales by \u20ac42.0 million in fiscal\n2011.

Of thes\ncountries, Brazil is currently the largest coffee consumer. Coffee consumption in Brazil has increased by approximately 45% in the\npast decade and the country now accounts for approximately 60% of the Latin American coffee market, according to the Brazilian\nCoffee Industry Association and J.P.

On January 19, 2011, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit\nagainst Sara Lee Coffee and Tea in the Netherlands after Sara Lee began selling espresso capsules in that country. In June 2011,\nNestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit against Sara Lee Coffee and Tea Belgium. Prior to this suit, on May 11, 2011, Sara Lee Coffee and Tea\nBelgium served a writ of summons on Nestl\u00e9 seeking a declaration of non-infringement in connection with Sara Lee\u2019s sale and\ndistribution of espresso capsules in Belgium. In October of 2011, Nestl\u00e9 requested preliminary injunctions against Sara Lee Coffee\nand Tea Belgium, seeking prohibition of Sara Lee\u2019s sale and distribution of espresso capsules in Belgium, and the request for\npreliminary injunctions was denied without prejudice to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s claims. In February 2012, Nestl\u00e9 appealed the decision to reject th\npreliminary injunctions. In February 2012, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar claim against Sara Lee Coffee and Tea in Spain. All of these\nproceedings relate to the alleged infringement of two or three European patents granted to Nestl\u00e9. In addition, in Spain, Nestl\u00e9 sued\ntrademark infringement and unfair competition. In the lawsuit filed in France, Nestl\u00e9 claims damages in the amount of \u20ac50 million f\neach claimant. If we are held to infringe any of the invoked patents, the court may determine a reasonable provisional damages\namount and deposit by Sara Lee. Any damages would be established in separate damage assessment proceedings. Management\nbelieves that the patents and trademarks granted to Nestl\u00e9 are not being infringed and further believes that the patents are invalid an\nthat the company has not engaged in unfair competitive practices.

Foreign exchange risk arises primarily from\n    commercial transactions such as the purchase of commodities, recognised monetary assets and liabilities and net\n    investments in foreign operations.\n\n\n\n                                                          F-19\n", "page_number": 172, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.10823529411764705, "top_left_y": 0.6722727272727272, "lower_right_x": 0.9317647058823529, "lower_right_y": 0.9004545454545455, "height": 0.22818181818181826, "width": 0.8235294117647058}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 13, "document_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c", "blob_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c-172-13", "text": "F-19", "page_number": 172, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.48470588235294115, "top_left_y": 0.9413636363636364, "lower_right_x": 0.5176470588235295, "lower_right_y": 0.9527272727272728, "height": 0.011363636363636354, "width": 0.03294117647058831}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c", "blob_id": "71bb5354cb30e880c5baa8e32e11903e51004d247c3054e771be3a7e7de2882c-173-0", "text": "      The Group uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short-te\n      foreign-currency-denominated intergroup transactions, third-party product-sourcing transactions, foreign-denominated\n      investments (including subsidiary net assets) and other known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on the\n      derivative instruments are intended to offset gains and losses on the associated transaction in an effort to reduce the\n      earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Forward currency exchange contracts\n      mature at the anticipated cash requirement date of the associated transaction, generally within 12 to 18 months. As of\n      fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Group has not designated any of its foreign exchange derivatives as hedges for account\n      purposes and, as a result, the change in fair value is recognised directly to the combined income statements. The Group\n      designated certain contracts as hedges for a period in fiscal year 2009. These were de-designated during the period and\n      amounts are recorded in profit.\n      Using the exchange rates as of the reporting dates, the net Euro equivalent of commitments to purchase and sell foreign\n      currencies is \u20ac1.2 billion and \u20ac1.2 billion, respectively, as of fiscal year 2011, \u20ac1.1 billion and \u20ac1.0 billion, respectively\n      as of fiscal year 2010 and \u20ac1.1 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion, respectively as of fiscal year 2009. The Group enters into\n      derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure for virtually all foreign exchange risk derived from recorded\n      transactions and firm commitments and anticipated transactions where the exposure is potentially significant.\n \u2022    Interest rate risk\u2014Interest rate risk comprises the interest price risk that results from borrowings at fixed rates and the\n      interest cash flow risk that results from borrowings at variable rates. To manage interest rate price risk, the Group has\n      entered into interest rate swaps that effectively convert certain fixed-rate debt instruments into floating-rate debt\n      instruments. Interest rate swap agreements that are effective at hedging the fair value of fixed-rate debt agreements are\n      designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.\n \u2022    Risk management\u2014The Group maintains risk management control systems to monitor the foreign exchange, interest ra\n      and commodity price risk and the Group\u2019s offsetting hedge positions. The Group utilises a sensitivity analysis techniqu\n      to evaluate the effect of any changes in interest rate, commodity prices and foreign currencies and the associated risk\n      derivatives.\n         \u2022    Commodities\u2014As of fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, if fair value of the Group\u2019s commodity derivative\n              instruments changed by 10% the profit of the Group would have changed by \u20ac4.3 million, \u20ac6.1 million and\n              \u20ac1.2 million, respectively.\n         \u2022    Interest rate swaps\u2014The Group has minimal exposure to interest rate movements due to the amount of\n              outstanding borrowings during the periods presented. The majority of the outstanding borrowings are at fixed ra\n              during fiscal years 2011 and 2010. The Group has converted this fixed rate into variable rate debt through the us\n              of derivative instruments. A 10% change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives during fiscal years 2011\n              and 2010 would have changed profit by \u20ac0.4 million and \u20ac0.7 million, respectively.\n         \u2022    Foreign currency\u2014As noted above, the Group has a foreign transaction exposure. The Group managed this risk\n              through the use of derivative financial instruments. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, if the fair value of\n              the foreign currency derivatives changed by 10%, the Group\u2019s profit for the period would have changed by\n              \u20ac52.8 million, \u20ac23.6 million and \u20ac16.0 million, respectively. In addition, during fiscal year 2011 the Group had\n              foreign currency options, which if the fair value changed by 10% would have changed profit by \u20ac1.0 million.\n\nCredit risk\nCredit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.

In assessing the goodwill in Brazil, the most significant assumption in testing i\n      the EBIT multiple. A change in the EBIT multiple of 1.0, which management believes is a reasonably possible change, would\n      not result in impairment. Although management currently believes the beverage operations in Brazil can support the value of\n      recorded goodwill, a change in assumptions driven by macro-economic conditions or degradation in the Brazilian consumer\n      coffee market that undermines the CGU\u2019s ability to achieve targeted profit levels may result in an impairment of their recorde\n      goodwill.\n\n8.    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n      Caf\u00e9 Damasco\u2014On 30 November 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Caf\u00e9 Damasco, a Brazilian coffee compa\n      The total purchase consideration was approximately \u20ac43.2 million, of which \u20ac24.1 million was paid at closing. The remaining\n      consideration of Brazilian real (\u201cR$\u201d) 42.8 million (approximately \u20ac19.1 million at the acquisition date) is payable in\n      installments over a five year period. The acquisition financing provided by the seller is included in Borrowings (see Note 17)\n      The fair value of the total consideration was \u20ac37.4 million, which represents the cash paid combined with the acquisition\n      financing on a discounted basis. In addition, the Group assumed outstanding borrowings of \u20ac7.1 million as part of the\n      acquisition. The Group incurred transaction costs of \u20ac0.5 million, which were expensed at the date of acquisition.\n      The allocation of the net assets acquired and goodwill arising at the acquisition date are as follows (all amounts in thousands o\n      Euro):\n\n                    Working capital................................................................................................................ \u20ac      1,078\n                    Property, plant and equipment .........................................................................................               10,423\n                    Trademarks ......................................................................................................................     12,045\n                    Other intangible assets .....................................................................................................          3,507\n                    Borrowings assumed on acquisition ................................................................................

Goodwill recognised is attributable to\n      this stronger presence in southern Brazil, the synergies to be achieved between the Group\u2019s existing operations and those of\n      Caf\u00e9 Damasco, and the non-assembled structured workforce that does not qualify for recognition separate from goodwill.\n      The operations of Caf\u00e9 Damasco and the related financial reporting were fully integrated upon acquisition, and as a conseque\n      the Group has not disclosed the revenues and profit included in its results as a result of this acquisition. Additionally, limited\n      financial information was available relative to Caf\u00e9 Damasco prior to the acquisition date. Therefore, it is not practicable to\n      provide disclosures related to revenue or profit as if Caf\u00e9 Damasco had been included throughout the entire period.\n      Caf\u00e9 Moka\u2014On 1 October 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Caf\u00e9 Moka, a family-owned coffee business\n      located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The purchase consideration was approximately \u20ac34.6 million, of which \u20ac13.1 million was paid a\n      closing in the form of \u20ac7.5 million in cash and \u20ac5.6 million representing the fair value of a property that was transferred. The\n      remaining consideration of R$57.8 million (approximately \u20ac21.5 million at the acquisition date) is due on the third anniversar\n      of the closing date and is payable in cash. The acquisition financing provided by the seller is included in Borrowings (see Not\n      17). The fair value of the purchase price, which was determined based on the cash paid, the fair value of the property transfer\n      and the discounted value of the acquisition financing, was \u20ac27.5 million.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n       Sara Lee maintains various equity compensation arrangements, which provide employees with restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d\n       or stock options to purchase stock in Sara Lee. Given that the Group receives employee services in consideration for the\n       participation of the Group\u2019s employees in these plans, a share-based payment expense for the awards granted to the Group\u2019s\n       employees has been reflected in the combined income statements. The compensation expense recognised for stock options an\n       RSUs was \u20ac4.6 million, \u20ac3.6 million and \u20ac3.2 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.\n       All stock options and RSUs will be impacted by the Separation. Option holders will have a choice to continue to hold their\n       options pursuant to their normal terms or to accelerate their vesting on the Separation date with a six-month window to exerc\n       At the time of exercise, these options will be settled in Sara Lee common stock with the awards adjusted to preserve their pre\n       Separation intrinsic value. All restricted stock units, both service-based stock units and performance-based stock units, will\n       immediately vest upon the completion of the Separation. These awards will also be settled in Sara Lee common stock with th\n       number of Sara Lee shares received on settlement adjusted to preserve their pre-Separation intrinsic value. The performance-\n       based stock units will be converted into the common stock of Sara Lee at the time of Separation based on Sara Lee\u2019s actual\n       financial performance through the most recent fiscal period end immediately prior to the Separation and on an assumed\n       achievement of the target financial performance for all periods after the Separation.\n       As Sara Lee is the grantor of the stock options and restricted stock units, and those awards are denominated in U.S. dollars, t\n       following details are disclosed in U.S. dollars.\n       Stock Options\u2014The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of Sara Lee\u2019s common stock on the date of\n       grant and is stated in U.S. dollars. The exercise price of the option granted is in U.S. dollars. Options can generally be exerci\n       over a maximum term of 10 years. The stock options generally cliff vest and expense is recognised on a straight-line basis\n       during the vesting period. Sara Lee grants rights to its equity instruments directly to the Group\u2019s employees. The equity\n       instruments granted are not the equity instruments of the Group, and the Group has no obligation to transfer cash or other ass\n       to the employees. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\n       model and the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\n                                                                                                                   2011             2010             2009\n      Weighted-average expected lives.............................................................               7.2 years        8.0 years        8.0 years\n      Weighted-average risk-free interest rates.................................................                      2.08%            3.03%            3.10%\n      Weighted-average expected volatility......................................................                    28.00%           27.20%           22.10%\n      Dividend yield..........................................................................................        2.90%            4.40%            3.00%\n\n       Sara Lee uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volati\n       assumptions.

The \u20ac78.8 million recorded by the Group differs from the\n      amount recorded by Sara Lee due to the exclusion of Divested Businesses in the Group\u2019s recognition assessments, as well as\n      corporate overhead allocations (as described in Note 1) and other income adjustments which differ from amounts reported on\n      tax returns of the legal entities that comprise the Group. As such, this deferred tax asset is a reasonable reflection of what wou\n      exist if the expenses reported on these combined financial statements were actually incurred and reported on the prior tax retu\n      filed by the legal entities which comprise the Group.\n      The Group has total unrecognised deferred income tax assets, including the unrecognised tax losses, described above, and oth\n      temporary differences, of \u20ac278.5 million, \u20ac276.1 million and \u20ac238.3 million as of fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009,\n      respectively.\n      The Group\u2019s tax expense includes \u20ac24.0 million, \u20ac50.8 million, and \u20ac27.6 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009\n      respectively, related to recapture and repatriation tax liabilities that are expected to be paid when certain cash balances are\n      repatriated, as well as non-U.S. earnings subject to U.S. tax currently. While a portion of these expenses were incurred\n      historically by Sara Lee, they resulted from the Group\u2019s operations and the Group expects to continue incurring similar expen\n      through the date of Separation. As such, these expenses have been reflected in the Group\u2019s combined financial statements as a\n      allocation of tax expense for the periods presented herein. Aside from the amount the Group intends to repatriate, the Group\n      intends to continue to reinvest its earnings for the foreseeable future and, therefore, has not recognised tax expense on these\n      earnings.\n\n20.

With the aid of asset liability management modeling\n analyses are made of possible future economic scenarios and investment portfolios. Based on these analyses, investment\n strategies are determined for each plan to produce optimal investment returns at acceptable funding ratio risk levels. Less\n favourable years can be part of these scenarios. The strategic targets changed substantially from 2009 since one of the Group\u2019\n pension plans in the United Kingdom with significant assets is inactive and therefore the plan assets are invested in fixed inco\n securities and cash instruments only, which are included in Other in the table above. Currently the strategic targets for the\n Group\u2019s main active pension fund are: 30% equity securities (including equity derivatives and forward currency contracts), 60\n debt securities and 10% other investments, cash included. Pension assets do not include any investments in shares of the Grou\n or Sara Lee.\n The expected return on plan assets is determined as a weighted-average rate of return based on the current and projected\n investment portfolio mix of each plan, taking into account the corresponding long-term yields for the separate asset categories\n which depend on components such as the risk-free rate of return in real terms, expected inflation and expected risk and liquid\n premiums. In addition, actual long-term historical return information is taken into account. The actual return on plan assets w\n a gain of \u20ac165.7 million, a gain of \u20ac285.6 million and a loss of \u20ac85.7 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respective\n Expected cash contributions to post-employment benefit plans for fiscal year 2012 are \u20ac163.0 million of which \u20ac60.0 million\n relates to a change in the Dutch pension fund where unconditional indexation was changed into conditional indexation for act\n employees and \u20ac26.0 million relates to required additional funding of the Dutch pension fund as per the existing contribution\n agreement. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent on a number of factors\n including minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the tax deductibility of amounts\n funded and arrangements made with the trustees of certain foreign plans.\n During 2006, the Group entered into an agreement with the plan trustee to fully fund certain U.K. pension obligations by 201\n The expected fiscal year 2012 contributions shown above reflect the amounts agreed upon for these U.K. plans. Subsequent to\n 2015, the Group has agreed to keep such plans fully funded in accordance with local funding standards.\n Post-Employment Medical Benefits\u2014The Group operates a post-employment medical benefit scheme in the Netherlands. T\n method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension\n schemes. This medical plan is an allowance type plan, which provides a fixed amount of benefits, and therefore does not assu\n any health care cost.

Nestl\u00e9 claims that damages could be as high as \u20ac50 million. In January 2011, Nestl\u00e9 filed suit\n    against Sara Lee/DE N.V., Douwe Egberts Nederland, B.V. and Douwe Egberts Koffie en Kado B.V. in the Netherland\n    a subsidiary of the Group, alleging patent infringements of the same two European patents as in the suit filed against\n    SLCTF. In June 2011, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit against Sara Lee Coffee and Tea Belgium (\u201cSLCTB\u201d). Prior to this sui\n    SLCTB had sought to obtain a declaration of non-infringement of the patents involved in the Dutch and French\n    proceedings. In addition, in February 2012, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit against Sara Lee Southern Europe, S.L. in Spain,\n    alleging patent infringement of three European patents, trademark infringement and certain other unfair competition\n    claims. Management believes that the patents granted to Nestl\u00e9 are not being infringed and further believes that the\n    patents are invalid. The Group is vigorously contesting the matter, and accordingly, no provision has been recorded as t\n    liability is not considered probable.\n\u2022   Spanish tax case\u2014In October 2009, the Spanish tax administration upheld a challenge made by its local field examinat\n    against tax positions taken by the Group\u2019s Spanish subsidiaries. In November 2009, the Group filed an appeal against th\n    claim with the Spanish Tax Court. In April 2010, the Spanish Chief Inspector upheld a portion of the claim raised by th\n    Spanish tax authorities. The Group is currently appealing the Court\u2019s decision. The Group continues to dispute the\n    challenge and will continue to have further proceedings with the Spanish tax authorities regarding the issue. In June 201\n    the Spanish tax administration\u2019s local field office examination made similar challenges against tax positions for the yea\n    ending July 1, 2006 to June 27, 2009 taken by the Group\u2019s Spanish subsidiaries. The Group filed an appeal against this\n    claim with the Spanish Tax Court.

In June 2011, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit against Sara Lee Coffee and Tea Belgium (\u201cSLCTB\u201d). Prior to this sui\n     SLCTB had sought to obtain a declaration of non-infringement of the patents involved in the Dutch and French\n     proceedings. In addition, in February 2012, Nestl\u00e9 filed a similar suit against Sara Lee Southern Europe, S.L. in Spain,\n     alleging patent infringement of three European patents, trademark infringement and certain other unfair competition\n     claims. Management believes that the patents granted to Nestl\u00e9 are not being infringed and further believes that the\n     patents are invalid.

In November 2009, the Group filed an appeal against th\n      claim with the Spanish Tax Court. In April 2010, the Spanish Chief Inspector upheld a portion of the claim raised by th\n      Spanish tax authorities. The Group appealed to the Tribunal Economico Administrativo Central (\u201cTEAC\u201d). At the end o\n      March 2012, the TEAC ruled in favor of the tax administration with respect to the audit for fiscal years 2003-2005. The\n      Group continues to dispute the challenge and will continue to have further proceedings with the Spanish tax authorities\n      regarding the issue. In June 2011 the Spanish tax administration\u2019s local field office examination made similar challenge\n      against tax positions for the years ending 1 July 2006 to 27 June 2009 taken by the Group\u2019s Spanish subsidiaries.
