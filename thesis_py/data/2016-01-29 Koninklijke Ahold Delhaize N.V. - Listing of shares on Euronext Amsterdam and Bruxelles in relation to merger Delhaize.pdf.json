This estimate\n          was prepared based on the fair value for debt disclosed by Delhaize in its financial statements for the\n          financial half year ended June 30, 2015. The fair value adjustment of debt will result in a reduction in\n          annual interest cost due to the reduction of the effective interest rate on debt. Based on the preliminary\n          valuation, reduction in interest expense of \u20ac15 million has been recorded to the unaudited pro forma\n          condensed combined income statements for the financial half year ended July 12, 2015 and \u20ac30 million\n          for the financial year ended December 28, 2014.\n\n      (f) A preliminary fair value adjustment of \u20ac26 million was estimated with respect to contingent lease\n          guarantees provided by Delhaize in relation to both operating and finance leases for operations that\n          have been sold. The fair value adjustment was estimated on the basis of the credit position of the\n          counter party (i.e., the acquirer) on behalf of whom lease guarantees have been provided and also\n          taking into account the location and re-let potential of each leased property. Of the estimated\n          adjustment of \u20ac26 million, \u20ac2 million has been included within Other current liabilities and \u20ac24 million\n          has been included within Other non-current liabilities.
