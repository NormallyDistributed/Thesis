Pursuant to\nour Articles and the resolution adopted by our general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cGeneral Meeting\u201d) on\n16 June 2004, QIAGEN\u2019s Supervisory Board is entitled to resolve to issue preference shares in case of an\nintended take-over of our Company by (i) any person who alone or with one or more other persons, directly\nor indirectly, have acquired or given notice of an intent to acquire (beneficial) ownership of an equity stake\nwhich in aggregate equals 20% or more of our share capital then outstanding or (ii) an \u201cadverse person\u201d as\ndetermined by the Supervisory Board.

Corbett is best known for having developed the world's first rotary real-\n    time PCR cycler system \u2013 the Rotor-Gene\u2122 \u2013 a system used to detect real-time\n    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions which make specific sequences of DNA and\n    RNA targets visible through amplification and quantifiable through real-time measurement\n    of such amplification. The addition of this proprietary PCR detection technology extends\n    our molecular testing solution portfolio and enhances our options to offer sample and assay\n    technology solutions spanning from sample to result.\n\u00b7   In February 2008, we acquired a business unit from Diagnostic Technology Pty. Ltd.,\n    located in Belrose, Australia, which relates to the distribution of products in Australia,\n    New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. In May 2008, we established QIAGEN Mexico via\n    the acquisition of certain assets of our former life science distributor Quimica Valaner. In\n    July 2008 we acquired the minority interest of our Brazilian subsidiary, QIAGEN Brasil\n    Biotecnologia Ltda. The establishment of QIAGEN Mexico represents our commitment to\n    expanding our presence in Latin America.\n\u00b7   In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of Digene Corporation (NASDAQ: DIGE)\n    through a tender offer and subsequent merger of Digene with and into a wholly owned\n    subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V. Following the completion of the merger, Digene became a\n    wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN North American Holdings, Inc. and was\n    subsequently renamed QIAGEN Gaithersburg, Inc. The merger combined our leading\n    portfolio of sample and assay technologies, including a broad panel of molecular\n    diagnostic tests, with Digene\u2019s leadership in HPV-targeted molecular diagnostic testing,\n    creating a global leader in molecular diagnostics outside blood screening and viral load\n    monitoring.\n\u00b7   In July 2007, we completed our acquisition of eGene, Inc. (OTCBB: EGEI), an early-stage\n    company located in Irvine, California that has developed and is commercializing a patented\n    sample separation and analysis technology based on capillary electrophoresis.\n\u00b7   In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisition of Genaco Biomedical\n    Products, Inc., located in Huntsville, Alabama. Genaco is an early-stage company applying\n    a proprietary PCR-based multiplexing technology, Tem-PCR, to develop Templex\u2122\n    molecular diagnostic tests. Multiplexing is a rapidly emerging segment in molecular\n    diagnostics and is also highly synergistic with our portfolio of qPCR-based molecular\n    diagnostic assays which in the segment of infectious disease diagnostics is considered to be\n    the broadest in the world. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we also acquired former\n    distributors PhileKorea Technology Inc., located in Daejeon, Korea, and ATC Health\n    Products Ltd., located in Ankara, Turkey.\n\u00b7   In the second quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisitions of Gentra Systems, Inc.,\n    located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Singapore-based Research Biolabs Pte.

Following the acquisition of Corbett, we anticipated a change in\nour purchasing pattern of the investee\u2019s products, which was expected to negatively impact the forecasted\nfinancial condition of the investee. Accordingly, we believed the known impact to the investee\u2019s financial\ncondition, absent other evidence indicating a realizable value of the investment, indicated that the\nrecoverability of the asset through future cash flows was not considered likely enough to support the\ncarrying value.\n", "page_number": 45, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.15058823529411763, "top_left_y": 0.745, "lower_right_x": 0.8423529411764706, "lower_right_y": 0.8836363636363637, "height": 0.13863636363636367, "width": 0.6917647058823531}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 9, "document_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac", "blob_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac-45-9", "text": "46\n", "page_number": 45, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.47058823529411764, "top_left_y": 0.9377272727272727, "lower_right_x": 0.4835294117647059, "lower_right_y": 0.9454545454545454, "height": 0.007727272727272694, "width": 0.012941176470588234}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac", "blob_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac-46-0", "text": "For the year ended 31 December 2008, interest income decreased to $9.5 million from $19.5 million in\n2007.

Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Plan. The summary of\nthe Stock Plan below is based on, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Stock Plan.\n\nPursuant to the Stock Plan, stock rights, which include options to purchase our Common Shares, stock\ngrants and stock-based awards, may be granted to employees and consultants of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and to members of our Supervisory Board. Options granted to members of our Supervisory\nBoard and our Managing Board must have an exercise price that is higher than the market price at the time\nof grant. On 20 June 2007, the General Meeting approved an amendment to the Stock Plan to the effect that\nthe maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Stock Plan is increased to 22,000,000, subject\nto certain antidilution adjustments.\n\nThe Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to our employees in the United States and\nnon-qualified stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards and other stock-based awards to all\nemployees, directors and consultants (approximately 2,000 people).\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan, our Supervisory Board has authorized our Compensation\nCommittee to administer the Stock Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate part of its authority\nand powers under our Stock Plan to one or more of our Supervisory Board members or officers, but only the\nCompensation Committee can make awards to participants who are Supervisory Board members or\nexecutive officers of the Company. In accordance with the provisions of the Stock Plan, our Compensation\nCommittee will determine the terms of options and other awards, including :\n\n               \u00b7         the determination of which employees, directors and consultants will be granted options\n                         and other awards;\n               \u00b7         the number of shares subject to options and other awards;\n               \u00b7         the exercise price of each option;\n               \u00b7         the schedule upon which options become exercisable;\n               \u00b7         the termination or cancellation provisions applicable to options;\n               \u00b7         the terms and conditions of other awards, including conditions for repurchase, termination\n                         or cancellation, issue price and repurchase price; and\n               \u00b7         all other terms and conditions upon which each award may be granted in accordance with\n                         the Stock Plan.\n\nThe Compensation Committee\u2019s decisions are subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board.\n\nGenerally, options have a term of ten years.

However, all or part of the trade tax is generally credited as a lump sum against the\n        shareholder's personal income tax liability.\n\n(iii)   Partnerships (Mitunternehmerschaften): If the Offer Shares are held by a partnership, personal\n        income or corporate income tax will be levied only at the level of the partners.

If the\n        partner is an individual, only 60% of the dividend income is subject to income tax plus solidarity\n        surcharge of 5.5% thereon (see subsection (ii) above). In general, if the Offer Shares are held as\n        business assets of a commercial permanent establishment located in Germany, dividends are fully\n        subject to trade tax at the level of the partnership. In the case of partners who are individuals, all or\n        part of the trade tax the partnership pays in proportion to the partner\u2019s interest in the partnership\u2019s\n        income is generally credited as a lump-sum against the individual partners\u2019 personal income tax\n        liability. If the partnership held at least 10% of the Company\u2019s registered share capital at the\n        beginning of the relevant tax assessment period, the dividends are not subject to trade tax.\n        However, to the extent that corporations have a participation in the partnership, 5% of the dividend\n        income is considered to be non-deductible business expenses will be subject to trade tax.\n", "page_number": 108, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.15470588235294117, "top_left_y": 0.16318181818181818, "lower_right_x": 0.8470588235294118, "lower_right_y": 0.64, "height": 0.4768181818181818, "width": 0.6923529411764706}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac", "blob_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac-108-3", "text": "If the shareholder is a sole proprietor, all or part of the Dutch withholding tax which was withheld from the\ndividends and which is not refundable under the Tax Treaty between Germany and the Netherlands may be\ncredited against the respective shareholder\u2019s personal income tax liability.

Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the\nremaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life. The Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures\nthat materially increase assets\u2019 useful lives and charging ordinary maintenance and repairs to operations as\nincurred. When property or equipment is disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and\namortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income (expense).\n\nAcquired Intangibles and Goodwill\nAcquired intangibles are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and consist of licenses to technology held\nby third parties and other intangible assets acquired by the Company. Amortization is computed over the\nestimated useful life of the underlying patents, which has historically ranged from one to twenty years.\nSFAS No. 142 \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d (SFAS No. 142) requires purchased intangible assets\nother than goodwill to be amortized over their estimated useful lives unless these lives are determined to be\nindefinite. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, intangibles are assessed for recoverability considering the contract\nlife and the period of time over which the intangible will contribute to future cash flow. The unamortized cost of\nintangible assets is evaluated periodically and adjusted, if necessary, if events and circumstances indicate that a\npermanent decline in value below the carrying amount has occurred.\nAmortization expense related to developed technology and patent and license rights which have been acquired\nin a business combination is included in cost of sales. Amortization of trademarks, customer base and non-\ncompete agreements which have been acquired in a business combination is recorded in operating expense\nunder the caption \u2018acquisition-related intangible amortization.\u2019 Amortization expenses of intangible assets not\nacquired in a business combination are recorded within either the cost of sales, research and development or\nsales and marketing line items based on the use of the asset.\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of the net assets\nacquired arising from business combinations. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is subject to\nimpairment tests annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based\napproach. The Company has elected to perform its annual test for indications of impairment as of October 1st of\neach year. Goodwill is potentially impaired when, in the first step, the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds\nits estimated fair value. Our reporting units are our subsidiaries. If impairment is indicated, then the second step\nof the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In testing for\npotential impairment, the estimated fair value of reporting units is based upon discounted future operating cash\nflows using a discount rate reflecting the estimated average cost of funds. Future cash flows are based on recent\nsales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches or capital projects, and customer\ncommitments related to new and existing products.

In accordance with FASB SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and\nDevelopment Costs, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to\nBusiness Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, amounts assigned to purchased in-process\nresearch and development meeting these criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the\npurchase business combination.

While the in-process research and development project was expected to represent new\ndifferentiating technology, the revenues forecasted for the project were a minor component of the overall\nprojected revenues.\nThe estimated fair values of the projects were determined using the income approach, which discounts expected\nfuture cash flows to present value. The fair value of the purchased in-process research and development was\nestimated using a present value discount rate of 25%, which is based on the estimated return requirements for\nthe projects and includes a premium over the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital due to the\ninherent uncertainties associated with the incomplete programs. The rate is consistent with Corbett\u2019s internal\nrates for similar research and development projects, and represents the rate market participants would use to\nvalue the purchased in-process research and development. The projected cash flows were estimated by\nforecasting total revenues expected from these products and deducting appropriate operating expenses, cash\nflow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in-process\ntechnology.

Fair Value Measurements\nEffective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities, which requires\nthe Company to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about\nfair value measurements. SFAS 157 clarifies the fair value measurement objective within U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles and its application under the varying pronouncements that require or permit fair\nvalue measurements. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value as follows:\n                       Level 1. Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets;\n                       Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted price in active markets, that are observable either\n                       directly or indirectly; and\n                       Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the\n                       reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities subject to SFAS 157 consist of derivative contracts used to hedge\ncurrency risk on foreign denominated assets and liabilities, which are classified in Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy.

This investment\nis accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\n\nAt December 31, 2007, the Company had a $4.0 million investment in a privately-held company accounted for\nunder the cost method of accounting. During 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Corbett, the Company\nrecorded a $4.0 million impairment of this investment based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the recoverability\nof the investment amount. Following the acquisition of Corbett, management anticipated a change in the\nCompany\u2019s purchasing pattern of the investee\u2019s products, which is expected to negatively impact the forecasted\nfinancial condition of the investee. Accordingly, the Company believes the known impact to the investee\u2019s\nfinancial condition, absent other evidence indicating a realizable value of the investment, indicates that the\nCompany\u2019s investment is worthless and that recoverability of the asset through future cash flows is not\nconsidered likely enough to support the current carrying value. The Company has no contractual obligation to\nprovide any additional investment or other financing beyond its present investment in the investee. The\nimpairment is included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAt December 31, 2008, the Company had a loan receivable of $1.4 million included in other long-term assets,\ndue from Dx Assays, which bears interest at 15% and is due in March 2013. As of December 31, 2008, total\nassets of Dx Assays totaled $4.9 million and shareholders\u2019 equity amounted to $189,000. In 2008, Dx Assays\nrecorded revenues of $121,000 and a net loss of $1.7 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2008 and 2007, total assets of QBM Cell Science totaled $233,000, and $383,000,\nrespectively, and shareholders\u2019 equity amounted to $191,000 and $317,000, respectively. In 2008, QBM Cell\nScience recorded revenues of $348,000 and a net loss of $280,000. In 2007, revenues of $303,000 and a net loss\nof $396,000 were recorded.\n\nThe Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture company, PreAnalytiX GmbH, for which the Company is\nnot the primary beneficiary within the provisions of FASB revised Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R),\n\u201cConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities.\u201d Thus, the investment is accounted for under the equity method.\nPreAnalytiX was formed to develop, manufacture and market integrated systems for the collection, stabilization\nand purification of nucleic acids for molecular diagnostic testing. At present, the Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss as a result of its involvement with PreAnalytiX is limited to the Company\u2019s share of losses\nfrom the equity method investment itself.

Investments and Variable Interest Entities\nInvestments\u2014The Company has made strategic investments in certain companies that are accounted for using\nthe equity or cost method of accounting. The method of accounting for an investment depends on the extent of\nthe Company\u2019s control. The Company monitors changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of the\nlevel of control. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of these investments for impairment,\nconsidering factors such as the most recent stock transactions and book values from the financial statements.\nThe fair value of cost-method investments is estimated when there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may have an impact on the fair value of the investment. As of June 30, 2009 and\nDecember 31, 2008 the aggregate carrying amount of cost-method investments was $4.2 million.\n\nVariable Interest Entities\u2014FASB revised Interpretation No. 46, \u201cConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities\u201d\n(FIN 46 (R)), requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary\nbeneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests. A variable interest\nentity is generally defined as an entity with insufficient equity to finance its activities or where the owners of the\nentity lack the risk and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture company, PreAnalytiX GmbH, for which the Company is\nnot the primary beneficiary within the provisions of FIN 46 (R). Thus, the investment is accounted for under the\nequity method. PreAnalytiX was formed to develop, manufacture and market integrated systems for the\ncollection, stabilization and purification of nucleic acids for molecular diagnostic testing. At present, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with PreAnalytiX is limited to the\nCompany\u2019s share of losses from the equity method investment itself.\nThe Company also has 100% interest in two entities established for the purpose of issuing convertible debt.\nThese entities are discussed in Note 8 below.\n", "page_number": 193, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.15, "top_left_y": 0.10909090909090909, "lower_right_x": 0.851764705882353, "lower_right_y": 0.5636363636363636, "height": 0.45454545454545453, "width": 0.701764705882353}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac", "blob_id": "62e923ce396347a16653d9d2c07b3f57f13d9cd1825059f348efc0be19bdaeac-193-2", "text": "7.   Derivatives and Hedging and Fair Value Measurements\nDerivatives and Hedging\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company uses derivative instruments, including swaps, forwards and/or\noptions, to manage potential losses from foreign currency exposures and variable rate debt. The principal\nobjective of such derivative instruments is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with global financial\nand operating activities. The Company does not utilize derivative or other financial instruments for trading or\nother speculative purposes. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance\nsheet, measures those instruments at fair value and recognizes the change in fair value in earnings in the period\nof change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.\n\nAs of June 30, 2009, all derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are cash-flow hedges. For derivative\ninstruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the\nderivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same\nperiod or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative\nrepresenting either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\nare recognized in current earnings.

Income Taxes\nFluctuations in the distribution of pre-tax income among the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries can lead to\nfluctuations of the effective tax rate in the consolidated financial statements. The Company\u2019s operating\nsubsidiaries are exposed to effective tax rates ranging from zero to approximately 42%. The provision for\nincome taxes is based upon the estimated annual effective tax rates. In the three- and six-month periods ended\nJune 30, 2009, the effective tax rate was 24% for both periods compared to the effective tax rate in the three-\nand six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 of 16% and 21%, respectively.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2009, the effective tax rate increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily as\na result of more income earned in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to the same period last year. The\noverall increase in rate is partially offset by favorable discrete events in both the first and second quarter. The\nimpact of discrete events to the rate for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was (4.3) %, and (5.3) % for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2009. The predominant events creating these discrete items relate to post-merger\nrestructuring associated with the Company\u2019s acquisition of Digene in 2007.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, \u201cAccounting for\nUncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of SFAS 109\u201d (FIN 48). At June 30, 2009, the Company\u2019s\nunrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $9.5 million which, if recognized, would favorably affect our\neffective tax rate in the periods in which it is recognized.\n\nIt is possible that approximately $1.2 million of the unrecognized tax benefits may be released during the next\n12 months. This amount relates predominantly to transfer pricing. These matters are expected to be settled either\nin the course of ongoing negotiations or when the statutes of limitations expire. We cannot reasonably estimate\nthe range of the potential outcomes of these matters.\n\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files numerous consolidated and separate income tax\nreturns in The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as in various other\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by\ntaxing authorities throughout the world. The Company\u2019s tax years since 2001 are open for income tax\nexaminations by tax authorities. Its subsidiaries, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to income tax\nexaminations by tax authorities for years before 2004.\n\nThe Company has undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries.
