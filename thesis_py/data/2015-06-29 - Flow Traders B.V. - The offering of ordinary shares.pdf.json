If we are not able to do so, our effective tax rate and tax expense would increase, which would\nlower our profit.\n", "page_number": 44, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1396614268440145, "top_left_y": 0.4715690466011116, "lower_right_x": 0.8579201934703748, "lower_right_y": 0.5951261222744763, "height": 0.12355707567336466, "width": 0.7182587666263603}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-44-6", "text": "We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n", "page_number": 44, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.14933494558645707, "top_left_y": 0.6083796494228303, "lower_right_x": 0.8373639661426844, "lower_right_y": 0.62248824283882, "height": 0.01410859341598969, "width": 0.6880290205562273}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {"risk_factor": ["We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes."]}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 7, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-44-7", "text": "Based upon an analysis of our current assets and income and the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness, we do not expect to be treated as a passive foreign investment company (a \"PFIC\") for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes for the preceding taxable year, the current taxable year or in the foreseeable\nfuture, provided that the current PFIC tax rules do not change.

If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the meeting, but\nan absolute majority of the votes cast is in favour of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a\nnomination, or to dismiss a board member, a new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may\nbe passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, regardless of the proportion of the capital represented\nat the meeting. In deviation of this best practice provision, the Articles of Association prescribe that the\nGeneral Meeting may pass a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a nomination for the appointment\nof a member of the Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or a resolution to dismiss a\nmember of the Management Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast,\nrepresenting more than 50% of the Company\u2019s issued capital. In addition, the Articles of Association\nprovide that if this proportion of the capital is not represented at the meeting, but an absolute majority of\nthe votes cast is in favour of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a nomination, or to dismiss a\nboard member, a new meeting may not be convened in which the resolution may be passed regardless of\nthe proportion of the capital represented at the meeting. This means that in order for such a resolution to\npass, a new meeting should be convened in which more than 50% of the Company\u2019s issued capital is\nrepresented and an absolute majority of the votes are cast in favour of such resolution. Our deviation from\nthe Dutch Corporate Governance Code in this respect makes it more difficult for our Shareholders to\nexercise influence over the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board than would\n", "page_number": 49, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1396614268440145, "top_left_y": 0.12612227447627192, "lower_right_x": 0.8603385731559855, "lower_right_y": 0.5746045318512185, "height": 0.4484822573749466, "width": 0.720677146311971}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-49-3", "text": "have been the case if we would follow the Dutch Corporate Governance Code in this respect.\n", "page_number": 49, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1396614268440145, "top_left_y": 0.5775972637879435, "lower_right_x": 0.7684401451027811, "lower_right_y": 0.5904232578024797, "height": 0.012825994014536213, "width": 0.6287787182587666}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-49-4", "text": "Holders of the Shares who are resident or located in certain jurisdictions outside the Netherlands,\nincluding the United States, may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights in future offerings and, as a\nresult, may experience dilution.\n", "page_number": 49, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1396614268440145, "top_left_y": 0.6015391192817443, "lower_right_x": 0.8597339782345829, "lower_right_y": 0.6430098332620778, "height": 0.04147071398033353, "width": 0.7200725513905684}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {"risk_factor": ["Holders of the Shares who are resident or located in certain jurisdictions outside the Netherlands,including the United States, may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights in future offerings and, as aresult, may experience dilution."]}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-49-5", "text": "In the event of an increase in our share capital, Shareholders are generally entitled to pre-emptive rights\nunless these rights are restricted or excluded either by a resolution of the General Meeting at the proposal\nof the Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, or by a resolution of the\nManagement Board with the approval of the Supervisory Board (if the Management Board has been\ndesignated at the General Meeting).\n", "page_number": 49, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.14026602176541716, "top_left_y": 0.6528430953398888, "lower_right_x": 0.8591293833131801, "lower_right_y": 0.7216759298845661, "height": 0.06883283454467726, "width": 0.718863361547763}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75", "blob_id": "655046f46635e6cfb7b77c69e92efbc40f6614a481ff66c6deec009460087e75-49-6", "text": "However, the securities laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict our ability to allow Shareholders to\nparticipate in offerings of our securities and to exercise pre-emptive rights.

At the date of this Prospectus, we are a cooperative with excluded\nliability (co\u00f6peratief met uitgesloten aansprakelijkheid) under the laws of the Netherlands. All members\nof the Management Board (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Co-CEOs and the members of the\nmanagement board of the Company prior to Conversion) and the Supervisory Board and most of our\nemployees are citizens or residents of countries other than the United States. Most of the assets of such\npersons and most of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States and the\nNetherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of\njudgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. In addition, the countries of\nresidence of the members of the Management Board (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Co-CEOs\nand the members of the management board of the Company prior to Conversion) and the Supervisory\nBoard and of our employees may also not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and\nenforcement of judgments. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by a court in the United\nStates, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the\nNetherlands. However, if a person has obtained a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a U.S. court\nwhich is enforceable in the United States and files a claim with the competent Dutch court, the Dutch\ncourt will generally give binding effect to such foreign judgment insofar as it finds that the jurisdiction of\nthe U.S. court has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal\nprocedures have been observed and that the foreign judgment does not contravene Dutch public policy\nand that the foreign judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment of a Dutch court given between the\nsame parties, or with an earlier judgment of a foreign court given between the same parties in a dispute\ninvolving the same cause of action and subject matter, provided that such earlier judgment fulfils the\nconditions necessary for it to be given binding effect in the Netherlands. It is uncertain whether this\npractice extends to default judgments as well. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of\npunitive damages or other awards.
