The Fund has a\n                         long-term investment horizon.\n\n                         As the Fund's principal activities consist of the (in)direct holding of property\n                         as an investment, such in line with its investment objectives, the Fund\n                         qualifies as a property company within the meaning of Directive 2003/71/EC\n                         and amendments thereto, including Directive 2010/73/EU (\u201cProspectus\n                         Directive\u201d). As a result, the additional criteria set by the Prospectus\n                         Directive for property companies will be complied with (i.e. the inclusion of a\n                         condensed valuation report in the Prospectus, see Annex).\n\n                         The Fund qualifies as an alternative investment fund within the meaning of\n                         Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\u201cAIFM Directive\") and is\n                         an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act\n                         (Wet op het financieel toezicht) (\u201cFMSA\u201d). The objective of the Fund is to\n                         invest capital in order to have the shareholders of the Fund share in the\n                         revenues.\nB.4a   Significant       In 2016, the Dutch office market saw significant recovery. The economic\n       recent trends     performance resulted in declining unemployment rates, in particular in office-\n                         related sectors of the economy. This has led to an increase in demand for\n                         office space. In 2016, vacancy rates of the Dutch office market declined as a\n                         result of a strengthening Dutch economy. Vacancy rates were also reduced\n                         by transformation of superfluous office space.\n\n                         Interest rates are at historically low levels and capital is looking for returns.\n                         In this environment it is believed that real estate investments, with strong\n                         direct returns, offer an attractive opportunity. Due to favourable conditions in\n                         financial markets, a lot of capital is currently being invested in real estate. As\n                         a result, investment volumes have increased significantly. Additionally,\n                         demand for sustainable office buildings is increasing.

tenants a healthy working climate, for example with ergonomically\n                sound working spaces, smart acoustics throughout the building, a constant\n                inflow of fresh air, and monitoring of CO\u2082 levels and air humidity (people and\n                project). In order to determine whether properties are truly sustainable, the\n                Fund has developed the Triodos Sustainable Real Estate Screen which\n                results in four scores for each property. The Fund strives for properties to\n                have at least a pass score (5.5) in three of these categories and have a\n                score of at least 7.5 for one P. For monuments the fund accepts the scores\n                for \u201cPlanet\u201d to be less than 5.5 as mostly these buildings are not energy\n                efficient. However, in the holding period the fund tries to improve the energy\n                efficiency of the buildings and thus improve the scores.\n\n\n                The Fund\u2019s office buildings are rented out to anchor tenants, but can also\n                partly be offered as flexible workspaces. The anchor tenant can be\n                surrounded by self-employed professionals and entrepreneurs with flexible\n                contracts, which could create collaborations between the different tenants\n                and increase liveliness. For this reason, the Fund seeks office buildings\n                located near public transportation hubs. The Fund believes that office\n                buildings thus become more attractive to tenants (profit).\n                It is the Fund\u2019s ambition to develop from \u2018zero emission\u2019 to \u2018zero energy\u2019,\n                meaning that the total amount of energy used by the buildings in the portfolio\n                on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy that\n                they generate collectively. The Fund wants to realise this by 1) further\n                reducing energy demand, 2) further increasing production of green energy\n                on site (in or with the buildings) by adding energy-generating assets to\n                buildings, such as solar panels, where this is technically and economically\n                feasible, 3) connecting the buildings through a smart grid. Such a grid will\n                contribute to optimising the generation and use of \u2018local\u2019 energy of the\n                individual properties in the portfolio. This can be achieved by enabling the\n                different buildings to exchange energy through a common grid, by\n                dynamically adjusting the energy demand of buildings to match the supply\n                and 4) storing energy in the buildings.\n\nMaximum         As a Fiscal Investment Institution with a 0% corporate income tax rate (\u201cFII\u201d),\nborrowing and   the Fund may employ leverage up to a maximum of 60% of the fiscal value\nleverage        of the Fund's real estate assets and up to a maximum of 20% of the Fund's\n", "page_number": 9, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.19044740024183796, "top_left_y": 0.24294268605645852, "lower_right_x": 0.9099153567110037, "lower_right_y": 0.8511548331907614, "height": 0.6082121471343028, "width": 0.7194679564691657}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-9-6", "text": "other assets.

The cost of energy\ndepends, among others, on the developments in the energy market, which makes the Fund subject\nto the developments in that market.\n", "page_number": 22, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.5419161676646707, "lower_right_x": 0.8657799274486094, "lower_right_y": 0.6736526946107785, "height": 0.13173652694610782, "width": 0.74546553808948}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-22-6", "text": "The Fund is exposed to the risk of revaluation losses with respect to its properties", "page_number": 22, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.6907613344739093, "lower_right_x": 0.7769044740024184, "lower_right_y": 0.7010265183917879, "height": 0.010265183917878562, "width": 0.6565900846432889}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {"risk_factor": ["The Fund is exposed to the risk of revaluation losses with respect to its properties"]}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 7, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-22-7", "text": "The Fund is exposed to the risk of revaluation losses with respect to its properties\nThe valuation of real estate is inherently subjective due to the individual nature of each property and\ncharacteristics of the local, regional and national real estate markets, which change over time and\nmay be affected by various factors and the valuation methods used.

Also in the\n    post economic crisis declining market conditions, the Fund was able to pay out distributions out\n    of operational cash flow.\n\n\uf0b7   At the same time, in a declining market, the Fund was able to reduce its amount of indebtedness.\n    The Fund reduced its long-term debt from EUR 43 million(unaudited) in 2011 to EUR 26 million\n    in 2016. Cash flow to reduce the debt came from sale of investments (around EUR 14\n    million(unaudited)) and operational cash flow.\n\n\uf0b7   As of 2014, the Fund believes to be a \u2018zero emission\u2019 real estate fund. The Fund achieves this\n    distinguishing status of not producing any greenhouse gas through the extreme low energy use\n    of the buildings in portfolio, the on-site production of sustainable energy by solar panels or\n    heat/cold storage installations, the exclusive use of green electricity and green gas and voluntary\n    compensation of the remaining Greenhouse Gas emission through CO 2 certificates. The Fund\u2019s\n    goal is to continue to be a zero emission real estate fund and further improve to \u2018zero energy\u2019,\n    meaning that the total amount of energy used by the buildings in portfolio on an annual basis is\n    equal to the amount of renewable energy that they generate collectively.\n\n\uf0b7   In 2016, the Fund decided to develop more flexible work spaces, in order to counter vacancy in\n    parts of the buildings and to increase liveliness of the buildings. The office building in Boxtel is\n    rented to multiple tenants since 2014 (at 31 December 2016: ten tenants). In 2016, the office\n    building in Amersfoort has been rented to one anchor tenant and several smaller tenants.\n\n\uf0b7   During the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, and up to the date of this Prospectus, the Fund did not\n    acquire any new buildings.\n\n\uf0b7   In December 2016 the Fund sold its property in Nijmegen. The net proceeds of the sale were\n    EUR 1,092,476. The proceeds were used to repay loans.\n\n\uf0b7   In June 2017 the Fund sold its property in Nieuwegein. The proceeds of the sale were EUR\n    3,225,058(unaudited). The proceeds will partly be used to repay loans and partly for new\n    investments. The property in Nieuwegein has been included in the valuation report of CBRE\n    Advisory B.V.

The most recent\nupdated aggregated valuation reports (relating to the assets and value of the real estate portfolio as\nper 31 March 2017) are attached to this Prospectus. These reports have been prepared by CBRE\nand Onafhankelijke Taxateurs Nederland B.V. (\u201cOTN\u201d). The value included in these valuation reports\nis consistent with the value of the assets as included in the calculation of the Net Asset Value of the\nFund per the same date. The Fund Manager and the Fund hereby assure that no material changes\nhave occurred in the value of the portfolio since the date of the valuation.\n\nValuation methodology\nThe real estate assets within the portfolio are valued on a fair value basis. The guidelines that the\nexternal valuer needs to adhere to, as laid down in the agreement between the Triodos IM and the\nexternal valuer(s), consist of the following:\n    - Fair valuation is based on the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors - Professional\n        Standards global January 2014;\n    - Fair valuation may not be in conflict with the IFRS of Fair Value;\n    - The external valuer should be able to independently, free from interference of any kind,\n        establish a fair value; and\n    - If the external valuer is not able to guarantee adherence to the aforementioned, the\n        engagement should be terminated without any further delay.\n\nValuation principles\nFor the purpose of the Fund's financial statements, the net asset value of the Fund (\u201cNet Asset\nValue of the Fund\u201d) and the net asset value per Share (\u201cNet Asset Value per Share\u201d) is calculated\nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands. Accordingly, the\ncalculations are prepared on the following basis:\n    - real estate assets are valued at the fair market value thereof (being \u201cthe estimated amount\n         for which an asset should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a\n         willing seller in an arm's-length transaction after proper marketing, wherein the parties had\n         each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion\u201d 16);\n    - other assets held by the Fund are valued at expected income, other liabilities at expected\n         payments;\n    - cash and bank deposits are valued by reference to their face value; and\n    - assets and liabilities in currencies other than euros (being the Fund\u2019s functional currency) are\n         translated into euros at the rates of exchange applying on the relevant valuation date.\n\nEstablishment Net Asset Value of the Fund\nThe results of the valuation of the real estate portfolio constitute an important element of the Net\nAsset Value of the Fund; the Fund Manager however remains ultimately responsible for the\ndetermination of the Net Asset Value of the Fund and is as such authorised to deviate from the\nvaluations as prepared by the external valuers (in case the Fund Manager deems this necessary and\nonly in case there are good grounds to value in another manner). The Net Asset Value of the Fund\nwill be published in an aggregate way on the Website each quarter.\n", "page_number": 70, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.09195893926432848, "lower_right_x": 0.8899637243047158, "lower_right_y": 0.8451668092386655, "height": 0.753207869974337, "width": 0.7696493349455864}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-70-1", "text": "16\n     RICS (2015), RICS valuation \u2013\n", "page_number": 70, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.886655260906758, "lower_right_x": 0.31680773881499397, "lower_right_y": 0.8999144568006844, "height": 0.013259195893926434, "width": 0.19649334945586458}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-70-2", "text": "\u2013 Professional Standards January 2014, page 85.\n", "page_number": 70, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.3174123337363966, "top_left_y": 0.8870829769033362, "lower_right_x": 0.6076178960096735, "lower_right_y": 0.8999144568006844, "height": 0.01283147989734823, "width": 0.29020556227327693}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-70-3", "text": "71\n", "page_number": 70, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4915356711003628, "top_left_y": 0.9439692044482464, "lower_right_x": 0.5078597339782346, "lower_right_y": 0.9546621043627032, "height": 0.010692899914456766, "width": 0.016324062877871803}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-71-0", "text": "As per 31 March 2017 the Net Asset Value per Share was EUR 3.65.\n", "page_number": 71, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.12031438935912939, "top_left_y": 0.09238665526090675, "lower_right_x": 0.6384522370012092, "lower_right_y": 0.10821214713430283, "height": 0.015825491873396075, "width": 0.5181378476420798}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13", "blob_id": "b83860986de8b835344563a01a3d242a59737808af05b97690c12dab912dda13-71-1", "text": "The Net Asset Value per Share is calculated by subtracting the total debts (long- and short-term\ndebt, other debt) from total assets (Investments, accounts receivable and other assets) and dividing\nthe result by the number of outstanding Shares.
