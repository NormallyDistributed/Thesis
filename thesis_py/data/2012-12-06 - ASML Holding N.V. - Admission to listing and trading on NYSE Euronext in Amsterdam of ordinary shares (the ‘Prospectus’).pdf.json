The number of systems sold increased\nby 181.4 percent to 197 systems in 2010 from 70 systems in 2009. This increase was caused by the recovery of the\nsemiconductor equipment industry, which started in the second half of 2009 and continued in 2010, as customers\ninvested in KrF systems for basic capacity growth and new leading-edge immersion technology in order to enable\nnew technology ramp-ups. In contrast, the first half of 2009, was characterized by the collapse of the\nsemiconductor equipment demand as a result of the financial and economic crisis.\n", "page_number": 44, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.4476271911073108, "lower_right_x": 0.8796856106408706, "lower_right_y": 0.5643437366395896, "height": 0.11671654553227878, "width": 0.7642079806529625}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86", "blob_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86-44-6", "text": "           For geographical reporting, net sales are attributed to the geographic location in which the customers\u2019\nfacilities are located.

In 2011, chip makers routinely produced electronic chip features with geometries of 32\nnanometers, compared to typical geometries of 10,000 nanometers in the early 1970s, resulting in an increase in\nthe number of transistors on leading chips from several thousand to over two billion. This trend was first observed\nby Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 (\u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d). Moore\u2019s Law has resulted in an information society\nwith fast wired and wireless communications - built on affordable chips. Moore\u2019s Law also has an impact on the\nenergy usage of chips. Smaller geometries allow for much lower electrical currents to operate the chip. This has\nhelped to contain the world\u2019s energy consumption despite the proliferation of affordable computing. Using\nadvanced semiconductors in industrial and consumer products often provides economic benefits, user-friendliness\nand increased safety. The technology revolution powered by semiconductors has brought many advantages: not\nonly can information be more widely disseminated than ever before, affordable chip intelligence has also enabled\nindustry and service sectors to create and distribute products and ideas at lightning speed.\n", "page_number": 52, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.7169730654125694, "lower_right_x": 0.8802902055622733, "lower_right_y": 0.8918341171440787, "height": 0.17486105173150923, "width": 0.7648125755743652}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 12, "document_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86", "blob_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86-52-12", "text": "53\n", "page_number": 52, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4879081015719468, "top_left_y": 0.9444206926036768, "lower_right_x": 0.5078597339782346, "lower_right_y": 0.9563916203505771, "height": 0.01197092774690034, "width": 0.019951632406287778}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86", "blob_id": "210302a2d1cc588002f8611c25c8a70ce4c352cf2a794a8f3f2574ea31c3fc86-53-0", "text": "          Smarter, smaller and more energy-efficient chips are made with increasingly sophisticated lithography\nsystems produced by ASML.
