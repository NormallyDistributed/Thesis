Our\nunique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems\nengineered to maximise well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage\ncaused during the completion of oil and gas wells. Our \"systems\" approach to the perforating of an oil\nor gas well has resulted in numerous patented products. Our HERO\u00ae (High Efficiency Reservoir\nOptimization), SuperHERO\u2122 and recently introduced SuperHERO Plus+\u2122 perforating systems have\nquickly become industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SuperHERO\u2122 and\nSuperHERO Plus+\u2122 perforating systems complement our successful HERO\u00ae line and are designed\nto optimise wellbore completions and stimulation programs in oil- and gas-shale reservoirs. Evolved\nfrom our HERO\u00ae charges, the SuperHERO\u2122 and the SuperHERO Plus+\u2122 charges use a proprietary\nand patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology that results in a deeper and\ncleaner perforating tunnel into the oil- and gas-shale reservoir. This allows greater flow of\nhydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximise hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir.\nMoreover, the deeper, near debris-free perforations enable lower fracture initiation pressures,\nreducing the amount of pressure-pumping horsepower required and its associated cost.\nSuperHERO\u2122 and SuperHERO Plus+\u2122 charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would\notherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation\nprograms needed for prolific production from the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar\noil- and gas-shale formations.

These\nongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and meaningful results obtained,\ncould spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or other\nregulatory mechanisms, which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by our\nexploration and production customers and thus reduce demand for our business.\n", "page_number": 139, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1396614268440145, "top_left_y": 0.05771697306541257, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.40017101325352716, "height": 0.3424540401881146, "width": 0.74546553808948}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-139-1", "text": "We may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\n", "page_number": 139, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11124546553808948, "top_left_y": 0.41342454040188115, "lower_right_x": 0.8851269649334945, "lower_right_y": 0.4407866609662249, "height": 0.027362120564343728, "width": 0.7738814993954051}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 2, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-139-2", "text": "Our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical\npersonnel.

In addition, there is doubt as to whether a court in one country would impose\ncivil liability on us or on the members of our supervisory board of directors in an original action\nbrought against us or our supervisory directors in a court of competent jurisdiction in another country\nand predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of that other country.\n", "page_number": 235, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.33133817870884996, "lower_right_x": 0.875453446191052, "lower_right_y": 0.4950833689610945, "height": 0.16374519025224454, "width": 0.7599758162031439}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-235-3", "text": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands,\nMay 2, 2011\n", "page_number": 235, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.5091919623770842, "lower_right_x": 0.34280532043530837, "lower_right_y": 0.5361265498076101, "height": 0.026934587430525903, "width": 0.22732769044740025}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-235-4", "text": "/s/ Jan Willem Sodderland\nJan Willem Sodderland, on behalf of\nCore Laboratories International B.V.\nsole managing director of Core\nLaboratories N.V.\n", "page_number": 235, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.4951632406287787, "top_left_y": 0.5485250106883284, "lower_right_x": 0.7841596130592503, "lower_right_y": 0.6156477126977341, "height": 0.06712270200940573, "width": 0.2889963724304716}, "blob_type": "headline", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-235-5", "text": "/s/ David M.

These assets are specific trade names which have been determined will be used and\nprovide future cash flows indefinitely. These intangibles are held by the Company and are included in\nan impairment analysis. We performed this impairment testing at December 31, 2008 assuming a\ngross margin of 25.6%, a growth rate of 5.8% and a discount rate of 11.7% and no impairment was\nindicated. The assets and liabilities making up our cash-generating units have not changed\nsignificantly, there have been no significant events and the circumstances surrounding our cash-\ngenerating units have not changed significantly, and our detailed calculation resulted in an amount\nthat exceeded our carrying amount of our cash-generating units substantially, therefore, no\nimpairment losses were recorded or reversed in 2009 or 2010.\n\nWe monitor or test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a\npotential impairment. For purposes of this test, we group our cash-generating units (\"CGU\") to a level\nequivalent to our reportable segments, and compare the recoverable amount of CGU groupings to\ntheir net carrying value. Fair value less cost to sell is determined by estimating the present value of\nprojected future cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital. We performed this\nimpairment testing at December 31, 2008 and no impairment was indicated at that time. In 2009 and\n2010, we re-assessed the appropriateness of this impairment test considering the limited changes in\nCGU assets and liabilities, the exceeding carrying amount of our CGU, and no significant events, and\ntherefore, no impairment has been recorded in 2009 or in 2010.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in our reportable segments as follows (in thousands):\n\n                                                                     2010              2009\nReservoir Description                                           $     99,368      $     99,368\nProduction Enhancement                                                83,186            77,569\nReservoir Management                                                  18,244            18,244\nTotal goodwill                                                  $    200,798      $    195,181\n\nThe key assumptions used for the impairment calculation at December 31, 2008 are as follows:\n\n                                                Reservoir        Production        Reservoir\n                                               Description      Enhancement       Management\n\nGross margin (1)                                   22%               32%               23%\nGrowth rate (2)                                    6%                 6%              2.5%\nTerminal growth rate (3)                           4%                 4%                4%\nDiscount rate (4)                                 11.7%             11.7%             11.7%\n", "page_number": 259, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.1154776299879081, "top_left_y": 0.30739632321504917, "lower_right_x": 0.875453446191052, "lower_right_y": 0.8755878580589995, "height": 0.5681915348439504, "width": 0.7599758162031439}, "blob_type": "table", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 3, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-259-3", "text": "Budgeted gross margin\nAverage growth rate used for the next 5 years to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period\n", "page_number": 259, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.17835550181378476, "top_left_y": 0.8896964514749893, "lower_right_x": 0.8319226118500604, "lower_right_y": 0.9162035057716973, "height": 0.026507054296707966, "width": 0.6535671100362757}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 4, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-259-4", "text": "(1)\n", "page_number": 259, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11608222490931076, "top_left_y": 0.8901239846088072, "lower_right_x": 0.13905683192261184, "lower_right_y": 0.9020949123557076, "height": 0.01197092774690045, "width": 0.022974607013301077}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 5, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-259-5", "text": "(1)\n(2)\n", "page_number": 259, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11970979443772672, "top_left_y": 0.9025224454895254, "lower_right_x": 0.14026602176541716, "lower_right_y": 0.9162035057716973, "height": 0.013681060282171864, "width": 0.02055622732769044}, "blob_type": "undefined", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 6, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-259-6", "text": "F-152\n", "page_number": 259, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.8996372430471584, "top_left_y": 0.950406156477127, "lower_right_x": 0.9431680773881499, "lower_right_y": 0.9610944848225738, "height": 0.010688328345446751, "width": 0.043530834340991476}, "blob_type": "header/footer", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 0, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-260-0", "text": "(3)   Average growth rate used to calculate a terminal value beyond 5 years\n(4)   Weighted average cost of capital is used as the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections\n", "page_number": 260, "bounding_box": {"top_left_x": 0.11608222490931076, "top_left_y": 0.08507909362975631, "lower_right_x": 0.8270858524788391, "lower_right_y": 0.10944848225737494, "height": 0.02436938862761863, "width": 0.7110036275695284}, "blob_type": "paragraph", "predictions": {}, "annotations": {}}, {"blob_number_in_page": 1, "document_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4", "blob_id": "780fdd17353e16ead04de6c063352dcaf1b312cee16c2ca96ef08d90c767e7d4-260-1", "text": "These assumptions have been used for the analysis for each CGU grouping.
